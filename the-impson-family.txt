#01x01^Marge:Oh, careful, Homer! Homer:There's no time to be careful, we're late. Class: ♪ O little town of Bethlehem ♪ ♪ O little town of Bethlehem ♪ ♪ How still we see thee lie ♪ Marge: Sorry, excuse me, pardon me, sorry. Homer: Hey Norman, how is it going? So you got dragged out here too, huh? Marge: Excuse me, excuse me. Homer: How are you doing, Fred? Yeah. Excuse me. Oops, pardon my galoshes. Skinner: Wasn't that wonderful? And now, the Santa's of many lands, as presented by the entire second grade class. Marge: Oh, Lisa's class. Girl: Frohlich Weihnachten. That's German for Merry Christmas. In Germany Santa servant Bruprecht gives presents to good children and whipping rods to the parents of bad ones. Boy: Merry Kurisumasu I am Hotiashi a Japanese priest who acts like Santa Clause. I have eyes in the back of my head so children better behave when I'm nearby. Mr. Largo: Now presenting Lisa Simpson as Towanga, the Santa Clause of the South Seas. Homer: Oh it's Lisa! That's ours. Skinner: Ah, the fourth grade will now favor us with a melody... er... medley of Holiday favorites. Class: ♪ Dancing through the snow, ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh, ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go, ♪ ♪ Dancing all the way, ho ho ho... ♪ Marge: Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like an angel. Bart: Jingle Bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg. The Batmobile broke its wheel, the Joker got awa-aah! Skinner: The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene form Charles... uh... Dickens'... A Christmas Carol. Homer: Oh, How many grades does this school have? Marge: "Dear friends of the Simpson family. We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First, the sadness: our little cat Snowball was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat Snowball II, so I guess life goes on. Speaking of live going on, Grandpa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself, Lisa got straight A's, and Bart... well, we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all." Homer: Marge! Haven't you finished that stupid letter yet? Marge: "Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays..." Homer: Marge! Marge: "...the Simpsons." Homer: Marge! Where's the extension cord? Marge: For heaven sakes, Homer, its in the utility drawer. Homer: Sorry I'm just a big kid. I love Christmas so much. Homer: D'oh! Marge: All right, children, let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole. Bart: Oh please, there's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa. Marge: A Pony? Oh Lisa, you have asked for that for the past three years, and I keep telling you that Santa cant fit a pony in his sleigh. Cant you take a hint? Lisa: But I really want a pony and I have been really really good this year. Marge: Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic. A tattoo?! Homer: A what? Bart: Yeah, they're cool, and they last for the rest of your life. Marge: You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas. Homer: Yeah, if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance. Bart: All right! Marge: Homer! Homer: Hello? Patty: Marge please. Homer: Who is this? Patty: May I please speak to Marge? Homer: This is her sister isn't it? Patty: Is Marge there? Homer: Who shall I say is calling? Patty: Marge please. Homer: It's your sister. Marge: Oh, hello. Patty: Hello Marge, its Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas Eve. Marge: Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit too. Patty: Somehow I doubt that Homer is excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked one who is always so rude to... Bart: Good one, Dad. Homer: Okay kids prepare to be dazzled. Marge, turn on the juice! What do you think kids? Lisa: Nice try, Dad. Bart: Ugh. Flanders: Hold your horses, son. Hey, Simpson! Homer: What is it, Flanders? Flanders: Do you think this looks okay? Bart: Whoa, neat-oh! Homer: Its too bright. Flanders, what a big show off. Marge: Kids, do you want to go Christmas shopping? Lisa: I do! Bart: All right, the mall! Marge: Go get your money. Homer: Tell us, Marge, where have you been hiding the Christmas money? Marge: Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around. You can look now. Homer: Oh, big jar this year! Marge: Oh, Bart that's so sweet. Its the best present a mother could get, and it makes you look so dangerous. Bart: One "Mother" please. Tattoo guy: Wait a minute. How old are you? Bart: Twenty one, sir. Tattoo guy: Get in the chair. Smithers: Attention all personnel. Please keep working during the following announcement. Smithers: And now, our boss and friend, Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns: Hello. I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase safety here at the power plant without increasing the cost to the consumer or affecting management pay raises. However, for you semi-skilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses. Oh, and one more thing Merry Christmas. Homer: Oh, thank god for the big jar. Marge: Where's that Bart? Bart: But Mom, I thought you would like it! Doctor: Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove your sons tattoo. Its a simple routine involving lasers. Bart: Cool! Doctor: However, it is expensive we must insist on a cash payment up front. Marge: Cash? Doctor: Mm-hmm. Marge: Thank god for Homers Christmas bonus. Bart: Aye Carumba! Doctor: Now, what ever you do boy, don't squirm. You don't want this sucker near your eye or your groin. Bart: Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it. Homer: Hey, what's this? Bart: Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo. Lisa: But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money to have it surgically removed. Homer: Oh, its true! The jar is empty! Oh my god, we're ruined. Christmas is canceled, no presents for anyone. Marge: Don't worry Homer we'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus even farther this year. Homer: Aah! Marge: Homer? Homer: Oh, yeah... my Christmas bonus. Hee hee... how silly of me. This will be best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had! Marge: I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer. Homer: Huh? Oh, I love you Marge. Marge: Oh, you tell me that all the time. Homer: Good, because I do love you. I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that wont set off that horrible beeping. Marge: Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but... Homer: Marge, let me be honest with you. Marge: Yes? Homer: Well... I... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year! Marge: Well, sure, okay. Homer: Marge, Marge, mmm, lets see... oh, look! Pantyhose! Practical and alluring. A six pack, oh, only 4.99. Ooh, pads of paper. I bet Bart could think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie... oh look, a little squeak toy! It says its for dogs, but she cant read. Flanders: Oh, ho ho Simpson, its you. Homer: Hello Flanders. Flanders: Oh my, what a little mess we've got here. Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine? Homer: Well, lets see. Flanders: Well this one's mine, and this one's mine. This ones mine, and... Homer: They're all yours! Todd: Hey, Mr. Simpson. You dropped your pork chop. Homer: Gimme that! Flanders: Well, happy holidays Simpson! Todd: Gee Dad, this is going to be the best Christmas ever. Flanders: You bet! Moe: What's the matter, Homer? Did someone leave a lump of coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long. Homer: So? Moe: So, its Christmas. Homer: Thanks Moe. Barney: Drinks all around! Homer: What's with the crazy get up, Barn? Barney: I got me a part time job working as a Santa down at the mall. Homer: Wow, can I do that? Barney: I dunno, they're pretty selective. Manager: Do you like children? Homer: What do you mean, all the time? Even when they're nuts? Uh, I certainly do! Manager: Welcome aboard, Simpson. Pending your completion of our training program that is. Santas: Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Teacher: What is it now, Simpson? Homer: Uh, when do we get paid? Teacher: Not a dime till Christmas Eve. Now, from the top. Santas: Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Homer: Um, Dasher... Dancer... Teacher: Mm-hmm. Homer: Prancer... Teacher: Mm-hmm. Homer: Nixon... Comet... Cupid... Donna Dixon? Teacher: Sit down, Simpson. Homer: And what would you like, little boy? Teacher: You're not really Santa, tubby. Homer: Why you little...! Teacher: Hey! No Homer, if such an emergency arises just tell them Santa is very busy this time of year, and you're one of his helpers. Homer: D'oh, I knew that one too. Marge: Homer, why are you 7 hours late? Homer: Not a word Marge, I'm heading straight for the tub. Marge: But Homer, my sisters are here, don't you want to say hello? Bart & Lisa: Daddy, Daddy! Bart: Welcome home! Lisa: Where so glad to see you! Homer: Why? Oh yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma, how was your trip. Patty: Fine. Homer: You both look well. Selma: Thank you. Homer: Yeah, well, Merry Christmas. Patty: It's Christmas? You wouldn't know it around here. Homer: And why is that? Selma: Well, for one thing there's no tree. Homer: Well I was just on my way out to get one! Lisa: Can we go too, Dad? Bart: Yeah, can we? Homer: No!! Guard: Hey you! What do you think you're doing? Homer: Uh-oh. Guard: Hey! Hey! Come back here! Homer: So, what do you think, kids? Beauty, isn't it? Bart: Wow! Lisa: Way to go, Dad! Selma: Why is there a birdhouse in it? Homer: Oh, that's an ornament. Patty: Do I smell gun powder? Boy: And then I want some Robotoids, and then I want a gook monster, and I want I great big... Homer: Ah son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you already got something much more important: a decent home, and a loving father that would do anything for you. Hey, I cant afford lunch, give me a bite of that donut. Milhouse: Get a load at that quote-unquote Santa. Lewis: I cant believe those kids are falling for it. Bart: Hey Milhouse, I dare you to sit on his lap. Milhouse: Oh yeah? Well I dare you to yank his beard off. Bart: Ah Touché! Girl: I hope you feel better, Santa. Homer: Oh, I will when Mrs. Clause's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening kid. Bart: Hey Santa, what's shakin' man? Homer: What's your name Bart... ner... uh, little partner? Bart: I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? Homer: I'm jolly old Saint Nick. Bart: Oh yeah, we'll just see about that. Homer: D'oh! Bart: Homer! Homer: I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop little boy! Cover for me Alphy. Bart: Don't kill me Dad, I didn't know it was you! Homer: Nobody knows! Its a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas I'd do anything. Bart: I'll say. You must really love us to sink so low. Homer: Well lets not get mushy son, I still have a job to do. Hey hey! Santa's back! Ho ho D'oh! Dammit! Homer: Ah, son, one day you're going to learn the satisfaction of payday - receiving a big fat check for a job well done. Cashier: Simpson, Homer. Here you go. Homer: Come on son lets go cash this baby and get presents for... aah! Thirteen bucks? Hey wait a minute! Cashier: That's right. $120 gross, less Social Security... Homer: Yeah... Cashier: Less unemployment insurance... Homer: But... Cashier: Less Santa training... Homer: Santa training? Cashier: Less costume purchase... Homer: Wait a minute... Cashier: Less beard rental... Homer: But... Cashier: Less Christmas club. Homer: But... Cashier: See you next year. Homer: Ohh... Bart: Come on dad lets go home. Homer: Thirteen bucks? You can't get anything for thirteen bucks. Barney: All right, thirteen big ones! Springfield Downs, here I come! Homer: What? Barney: You heard me, I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Want to come? Homer: Sorry Barney, I may be a total wash out of a father but I'm not going to take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve. Barney: Come on Simpson, the dogs name is Whirlwind. Ten to one shot. Money in the bank. Homer: Uh-uh. Bart: Aw, come on Dad. This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, its that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it going to happen to us. Homer: Well, okay lets go. Who's Tiny Tim? Elf 1[b]: Hey, Moley, do you think Santa will be able to find Elf County under all this snow? [b]Elf 2[b]: I doubt it, Bubbles. We'll be sad little elves this Christmas. [b]Lisa: Oh no! Grampa: Oh Brother. Selma: Where's your husband? Patty: Yeah, its getting late. Marge: Well, he said he went caroling with Bart. Bart & Barney: We're in the money! We're in the money! Homer: I can't believe I'm doing this. Kid: Can we open our presents now, Dad? Father: You know the tradition, son, not till the eighth race. Homer: Hey Barney, which one is Whirlwind? Barney: Number six. That's our lucky dog right over there. He won he last five races. Homer: What, that scrawny little bag of bones? Bart: Come on Dad, they're all scrawny little bags of bones. Homer: Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas. Announcer: Attention racing fans, we have a late scratch in the fourth race. Number eight Sir Galahad will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper once again Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper. Homer: Bart did you here that? What a name - Santa's Little Helper. It's a sign. It's an omen. Bart: It's a coincidence, Dad. Homer: What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper? Man: Ninety nine to to one. Homer: Wow! Ninety nine times thirteen equals... Merry Christmas! Bart: I got a bad feeling about this. Homer: Don't you believe in me son? Bart: Uh... Homer: Come on boy, sometimes your face is all that keep me going. Bart: Oh... go for it, Dad. Homer: That's my boy! Everything on Santa's little Helper. Elves: Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Lisa: Yay! Grampa: Unadulterated pap. Patty: It's almost nine o'clock. Selma: Where is Homer anyway? Patty: It's typical of the big doofus to spoil it all. Lisa: What Aunt Patty? Patty: Oh nothing, dear. I'm just trashing your father. Lisa: Well, I wish that you wouldn't. Because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you beer in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me, and I am far to young to cartoon myself against such onslaughts. Patty: Mmm-hmm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear. Homer: Come on Bart, kiss the ticket for good luck. Not that we need it! Announcer: Here comes Shirley the mechanical rabbit. And they're off. Around the first turn, it's Whirlwind in the lead, and coming up on the left is Quadruped followed by Dog of War and Fido. Announcer: Dog of War coming up fast on the outside. And in last place... is Santa's Little Helper. Homer: D'oh! Oh... Bart: Don't worry Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens. Homer: Come on you stupid dog. Bart: Come on boy. Announcer: Whirlwind wins by a country mile followed by Dog of War. Homer: D'oh! Bart: It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me. Homer: I don't want leave till I dog finishes. Ah forget it, lets go. Homer: Find any winners son? Bart: Sorry, Dad. Barney: Hey Simpson, what did I tell you - Whirlwind. Lets go Daria. Man: Beat it! Scram, get lost! You came in last for the last time! Bart: Look Dad, its Santa's Little Helper. Man: And don't come back! Homer: Oh no you don't! No, no, get away from me! Uh-uh. Bart: Oh, can we keep him dad please. Homer: But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's... a Simpson. Marge: Mmm... maybe we should call the police. Patty: He'll sober up. Selma: Yeah, come staggering home. Patty: Uh-huh. Smelling like cheap perfume. Marge: Homer! Grampa: What? Wha? Homer: Look everybody, I have a confession to make. Patty: This should be good. Homer: I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried to not let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did... Bart: Hey everybody, look what we got! Lisa: A dog! All right dad! Marge: God bless him. Lisa: So love at first sight is possible. Bart: And if he runs away he'll be easy to catch. Marge: This is the best gift of all, Homer. Homer: It is? Marge: Yes, something to share our love. And frighten prowlers. Lisa: What's he's name? Homer: Number 8. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

#01x02^Come on, Mom. Yeah, Mom. Hurry up. All right. Mmm. How about "he"? Two points. Your turn, dear. Homer: Hmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters? Oh, wait. Here's a good one." Do." Lisa: "Id." Triple word score. Homer: Hey, no abbreviations. Lisa: Not I.D., Dad."Id." It's a word. Bart: As in, "This game is stup-id." Hey, shut up, boy. Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be developing verbal abilities... for your big aptitude test tomorrow. We could look this "id" thing up in the dictionary. We got one? I think it's under the short leg of the couch. "Id: Along with the ego and the superego... one of three components of the psyche." Get outta here. Bart: Here we go. Kwyjibo. K-W-Y-J-I-B-O. Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here. Homer: Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a "kwyjibo" is. Bart: "Kwyjibo." Uh-- A big, dumb, balding, North American ape with no chin. Marge: And a short temper. Homer: I'll show you a big, dumb, balding ape! Bart: Uh-oh. Kwyjibo on the loose. We come from Springfield and we sell swampland you there. No chewing gum on school grounds. In the trashcan with it. Principal Skinner... one of my fellow children is vandalizing school property. Oh? Where? Over there, sir. See? Look out, Bart. Here comes Skinner. Yikes! Hmm. Principal Skinner: Whoever did this is in very deep trouble. Martin: And a sloppy speller too. The preferred spelling of "wiener" is w-I-e-n-e-r... although "e-I" is an acceptable ethnic variant. Principal Skinner: Good point. Boys, let's see your hands. Mm-hmm. Good. Okay. Simpson? You might say you caught him red-handed. Simpson, you and I are going to have a little talk. Same time, same place? Yes. In my office after school. Ooh! Bart, I hope you won't bear some sort of simpleminded grudge against me. I was merely tying to fend off the desecration of the school building. Eat my shorts. Pardon? Now, I don't want you to worry, class. These tests will have no effect on your grades. They merely determine your future social status and financial success. If any. Mrs. Krabappel, isn't Bart supposed to face the window... so he won't be tempted to look at his neighbor's paper? You're right, Martin. Bart? Remember to visualize the complex problems, and relax. The test will start... now! Bart: "At 7:30 a.m., an express train traveling 60 miles an hour... leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, 520 miles away." Shh! Visualize it, Bart. Bart: "At the same time, a local train traveling 30 miles an hour... and carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe. It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car. An hour later, a number of passengers... equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off... but three times as many plus six get on. At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off... but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop." Oof! Train conductor: Ticket, please. Bart: I don't have a ticket. Train conductor: Come with me, boy. We've got a stowaway, sir. Bart: I'll pay. How much? Martin: Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff... minus two-thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso. Whoa! Bart, there are students in this class with a chance to do well. Will you stop bothering them? He's not bothering me, Mrs. Krabappel. I'm finished. May I go outside and read under a tree? Certainly, Martin. What are you looking at, Bart? Are those naughty dogs back again? You have 20 minutes, class. He's a good boy now, and he's getting better... and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock... and need to be hugged extra hard. That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this. "I am a wiener." He sure is. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here. Send them in. Hello again. What have you done this time, boy? Principal Skinner: I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at $75, and frankly... we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill. Homer: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do? Homer: Oh, no. He can't mean that. My wife thinks you want me to pay for it. Principal Skinner: That was the idea. Homer: Oh. By itself, something like this might not call for an extreme penalty... but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes... that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to-- Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision-- Mr. Skinner, Dr. Pyor is here to see you. He says it's urgent. Send him in. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this is our district psychiatrist, Dr. J.Loren Pryor. What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts. Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning... has revealed that the young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child." A what? Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson. Bart? This lunkhead? Impossible. No, no, we're quite certain. Dr. Pryor: The child is not supposed to know his own IQ, of course... but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt. Homer: 912! Dr. Pryor: Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's 216. Homer: Oh. That's still amazingly high. Dr. Pryor: Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school? Bart: Oh, you bet. Dr. Pryor: Mm-hmm. Ever feel a little frustrated? Bart: All the time, sir. Dr. Pryor: Uh-huh. Do you ever dream of leaving your class... to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis? Bart: Wow! It's like you're reading my mind, man. Uh-huh. You see, when a child with Bart's intellect... is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person... he's probably going to lash out in ways like these. Principal Skinner: I think we should retest him. Dr. Pryor: We should move him to another school. Principal Skinner: Ooh. Better yet. Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of school... that doesn't rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers. A school without walls... where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to. Does that sound good, Bart? Sign me up, Doc. Excellent. We're all set. Here's all the information you need. Show up around nine-ish. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, congratulations once again. I think we're all in a mood to celebrate. Homer: Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius? How does it happen? Dr. Pryor: Genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment. Dr. Pryor: Although, in some cases, it's a total mystery. Aw, come on, Mom. You look very intelligent, dear. No way! How about a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties. You're stifling my creativity, Dad. Sorry, boy. Marge: Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious? Homer: Nonsense, Marge. Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today. It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Homer: Lisa, maybe you should try some of this. Marge: Homer! Homer: I'm just saying why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up. I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit. Maybe so, but from now on... this dimwit is on easy street. No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route. Gotcha. Bart: Oh, no. Ties. Homer: Don't worry, son. You can have mine. Here. Let me show you how to put on a tie. The hook goes over the top and these things go in there. Thanks, Dad. You kissed me. There's nothing wrong with a father kissing his son. I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention. Because if you do, one day you may achieve something... that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone. You must be Bart Simpson. I'm Ms. Melon, your learning coordinator. Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here: Make your own rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading. What should I read, ma'am? Anything you want, Bart. Oh! A comic book? How did this get mixed in here? We used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy. Bart, these are the students who will share your work area. This is Ethan Foley. O Memsahib, Bart. Rabbi has memo. What? Ethan's very good with palindromes. You know, sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards. And this is Sidney Swift. Trabing norm doog. What's your problem? Oh, don't mind Sidney. He's just speaking in backwards phonetics today. He said, "Good morning, Bart." And this is Cecile Shapiro. Hi, Bart. Cool hamsters. What are their names? Hamster Number One has been infected with a staphylococci virus. Hamster Number Two is the control hamster. Hi, little control hamster. I wouldn't get too attached. We're dissecting him next week. Discover your desks, people. Now let's all welcome the newest member... of our collective experience, Bart Simpson. And now we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing... that free will is an illusion. If you ask me, humankind has freedom... a freedom fraught with paradoxes. Freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind... but this helps us to think for ourselves. Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have an example of a paradox? Without law and order, man has no freedom. If you want peace, you must prepare for war. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, it seems the smartest child in the class... is also the quietest. Ms. Melon: Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives? Bart: Well... you're damned if you do... and you're damned if you don't. Well, I guess that would be a paradox too. Thank you, Bart. Whew! Tell you what, Bart. I'll trade you the weight of a bowling ball... on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch... for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch. Well, okay. There you go! I'll trade you 1,000 picoliters of my milk for 4 gills of yours. Well, all right. Anything you say. Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my-- Save your breath. What do you think of the new kid? A rather mediocre genius. Yes, not very bright at all. So, how was it? Os-os. What? That's backwards for so-so. Wow. What are you reading there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh? Tell you what. To celebrate your first day of genius school... what do you say we go out for a round off rosty chocolate milkshakes? All righty! Marge: Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... mmm, hmm-- What's that word where you encourage something to grow? Lisa: Nurturing. Marge: Nurturing your brilliant brain... so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up. Get dressed. It starts at 8:00. Bart: Oh, Mom. Not tonight. Homer: Bart, your mother's only tying to help, so go ahead and enjoy the show. Marge: Homer, you're going too. Homer: But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer? Hey, Lis, keep an eye out for the guy with the peanuts. There's no guy with peanuts, dear. Geez. No beer. No opera dogs. Shh! ♪ Toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor ♪ ♪ Please use the cuspidor ♪ ♪ That's what it's for ♪ Marge: Bart, stop fooling around. Homer, stop encouraging him. Homer: Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him. Shush! Shh! Homer: Who's the lard butt? Lisa: He's the bullfighter. Bart: No way a bull's gonna miss a target that big, man. Who are those people? P.U. When is this over? It ain't over till the fat lady sings. Is that one fat enough for you, son? Let's go get a burger. Ms. Melon: So, "Y" equals "R" cubed over three. And if you determine the rate of change in this curve correctly... I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Ms. Melon: Don't you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared... D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R. Har-dee-har-har. Get it? Bart: Oh, yeah. Hi, guys. Great to see ya. Get lost, Poindexter. Yeah, beat it, Professor. Why don't you go build a rocket ship, brainiac? Well, come on, you two. Don't forget about the film festival. The what? Oh, sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie... directed by some Swedish meatball. Oh, no. Well, I guess we don't have to do that. Um, look, Dad. I got something to tell you. Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark. All right, Homer. Come on, baby. Right across the plate. Let me feel the wind. Whoa! Strike two! Two and two. Can you still see the ball, Bart? Don't worry, Home boy. You're not that fast. Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat. Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're outta there! So, what was it you wanted to tell me, son? Oh, nothing, Pop. I'm still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart. If we don't get any volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody. Say, what's that? It looks dangerous. Well, it's really pretty top secret, ma'am. All right, keep going. But you do know what happens when you mix acids and bases, right? 'Course I do. Sorry. Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobody's angry about this. We're-- We're just concerned. When a young man with a 216 IQ can't make a simple experiment work... well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong. Tell me. Is the class moving too slowly for you? Lord, no. Well, then, what can we do to make you happy? I wanna go back to my old class. Oh, but, Bart, don't you remember the boredom... the ennui, the intellectual malaise? Yeah, well, you know, kinda, um... but I was thinking I could go undercover. Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on. Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid. You know, to study them and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick. I see. Like Jane Goodall and the chimps. Yeah. Uh-huh. This is most impressive, Bart. You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner. Proposal? you know, outline your project... what you hope to achieve, what you'll require to do it. Gotcha, man. "'My proposal' by Bart Simpson." I want to pretend... I am a regular dumb kid. Period. "By this, I hope--" Oh, no. "For this, I will--" Ohh." Require--" Ohh. Oh, man. "'My Confession' by Bart Simpson." I am a regular dumb kid. Period. "I cheated on my intelligence test. Period." Ah, finished already? Principal Skinner will be very interested to-- to-- Oh. You know... you misspelled "confession." Hey, lookin' good, Bart. Bart, what happened? I had a little accident in chemistry today. Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son. Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors... before he invented the lightbulb. Dad, I gotta tell you something. Hope you won't be too mad. What is it, son? I'm not a genius, Dad. What? I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But l just want to say... that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together. You've helped me out with things... and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad. And I think if something can bring us that close... it can't possibly be bad. Why, you little-- Uh-oh. What's going on out there? I think Bart's stupid again, Mom. Oh, well. You can't stay in there forever! I can try. March your butt right out here, now! No way, man. But-- Son, if you don't come out... I can't hug you and kiss you and make you feel all better. You think I'm dumb enough to fall for that? I'm insulted. Shh!
#01x03^Now class, I don't want this field trip to be a repeat of our infamous visit... to the Springfield State Prison. So, I want you all to be on your best behavior, especially you, Bart Simpson. Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door. Uh, sorry, little dudes. Party hardy was tardy. All right, children. Count off. One, two, three. Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman. Hey, Bart dude. Any new tattoos, Otto? Oh, funny you should ask, man. This morning I woke up with this one. Cool. I want one. Huh. Not till you're 14, my little friend. Bart! Bart Simpson! Take your seat, Bart. Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride. No offense, Wendell. Oh. Be that as it may, it's the only seat left, so get in there! Please try not to shake the seat like that. Now, class, remember. Do not stick any part of your body out the window. We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck his arm out the window... and had it ripped off by a big truck coming in the other direction. And I was that boy. Uh, Bart Simpson, sit down! I've had just about enough of your tomfoolery. Oh, I don't feel so hot. Look, there's our school again. Otto, are you sure you-- It's a shortcut, Mrs. K. Trust me. Mrs. Krabappel! Mrs. Krabappel! Bart, not another word out of you, or I'll subject you to the humiliation... of making you sing in front of the class. Can I pick the song? No. The song will be "john Henry Was a Steel Drivin' Man." Oh, no. We're gonna make you sing, Bart Simpson. Yeah, Bart Simpson, we're gonna make you sing. That's it, Bart. Oh, why can't you be more like, uh, uh-- Us, Mrs. Krabappel? Yes, Sherri and Terri. They know how to behave. Da, da, da, da, da, da. Whoa! Da, da, da, da, da, da. Whoa! They took Bart Simpson to the graveyard Oh, yeah, and every locomotive that comes rollin' by Bart. Bart! Says there lies a steel-drivin' man Lord, Lord, oh, there lies a-- Okay, Bart. Enough! Hey, Wendell, you made it, buddy. And so, this plant harnesses the power of the atom... so that we have the energy to run everything from your favorite video game... to yummy cotton candy machines. Let's learn more about nuclear energy, shall we? Lights. When most people think of nuclear energy, they think of this. But when we talk about nuclear energy, we really mean this. But what exactly is nuclear energy? I don't know, but I know someone who does. Smilin' Joe Fission. Hi, there, energy eaters. I'm Smilin'joe Fission, your atomic tour guide... to the strange and exciting world of nuclear power. And these are rods of uranium 235. Hi, Rod. Hi. Hey. Good to see ya. Hey, you guys look hot. Of course we're hot. We're radioactive. Uh-oh. Well, how 'bout a dip in the pool? Yeah! Last one in's the rotten rod! The rods make the water so hot it boils. Ow! Ouch! Ow! And the steams pins turbines that generate energy. Bart, sit down. Uh-oh. Whoops. Looks like there's a little leftover nuclear waste. No problem. I'll just put it where nobody'll find it for a million years. So, now you know the whole true story of nuclear energy, our no longer misunderstood friend. So, keep on smilin'. Now, let's have even more fun. And, uh, over here is our thermal regulator. To your right, if you look through this window, you'll see where our water rejoins the rest of nature's biosphere. Hey, Bart, our dad says your dad is incompetent. What does incompetent mean? It means he spends more time yakking and scarfing down doughnuts than doing his job. Oh, okay. I thought you were putting him down. You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference... between these doughnuts and ones baked today. My boy's supposed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet? Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around... on your butt and stuffin' your face, they'd take them on a tour of your house. You're right. I gotta get where the action is. Comin' through! Hey, there's my dad. Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer! Woo! Woo! I'm up here! Oh, hi, boy! All right. Who's responsible for this? I might have known it was you, Simpson. But, sir, I-- I don't want to hear about it, Simpson. You're fired! Oh, hi, girls. Hi, Daddy. Here's a good job at the fireworks factory. Those perfectionists? Forget it. How 'bout this? Supervising technician at the toxic waste dump. I'm no supervising technician. I'm a technical supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big, worthless nothing. There, there, Homer. You'll find a job. You've caused plenty of industrial accidents, and you've always bounced back. Yeah, Dad, you can do it! Yeah, go for it, Dad. You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied and I'll take anything! Watch out, Springfield. Here I come. Don't give up, Dad. I'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much. Moe's Tavern. Is Mr. Freely there? Who? Freely. First initials "I.P." Hold on. I'll check. Uh, is I.P.Freely here? Hey, everybody! I.P.Freely! Wait a minute. Listen to me, ya lousy bum. When I get a hold of you, you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half. You'll get that punk someday, Moe. Ah, I don't know. He's tough to catch. He keeps changing his name. Oh, I think I'll have another-- Oops. Oh, I'm a little low on funds. Do you think you can cover me just this once? No, sorry. W-Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation. I don't think you're ever gonna get another job and be able to pay me back. Oh. Don't worry. We're still friends. I fall to pieces All you all right, Homer? I'm fine. I'm just thinking. Well, I've been thinking too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted. You think you can still do that kind of work? Sure. You never forget. It's just like riding a bicycle. Hey, Mama, where's my fries already? Dad, eat something. It's got mustard on it. All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale. I don't know what else to do. There's only one thing we can do: Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad. Loaf time, the cable network for the unemployed. We'll be back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this. Unemployed? Out of work? Sober? You sat around the house all day, but now it's Dufftime. Duff, the beer that makes the days fly by. Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff Duffbeer Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. There must be some beer here somewhere. Ah. Maybe in here. Damn! I need money! Oh, no. What have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute. Let me count and make sure. Not even close. Dear family. I am an utter failure, and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watey grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: "Stand tall, have courage and never give up." I only hope I can provide a better model... in death than I did in life. Warmest regards. Love, Homer J. Simpson. Nothing's easy. Oh, looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself. Well, maybe not. Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk. Oh. Mom! Mom! Wake up! We've been robbed! What? Someone swiped my piggy bank! Your father's gone too! Look what I found. Almost there. Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going! Well, live and learn. There he is! Don't do it, Dad! Boy, this intersection is dangerous. Someone ought to put a stop sign here. Oh, Homer. How could you think of killing yourself? We love you. Yeah, Dad. We love you. Yeah. Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign! Next on the agenda. Police Chief Wiggum... will give us an update on our graffiti problem. Well, it's no secret our city is under siege... by a graffiti vandal known as " El Barto." Police artists have a composite sketch of the culprit. If anyone has any information, please contact us immediately. Cool, man. Tough customer. Ooh, wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley. And now, new business. Homer Simpson, local resident, has something. Mr. Simpson? Don't be nervous. We believe in you, Homer. Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from dinosaurs that tormented our caveman ancestors to the-- Simpson, get to the point. I think we should put a stop sign at " D" Street and 12th. The other-- All in favor? Aye. Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee and maple logs in the lobby. Wow. They listened to me. All right, Dad! Way to go, Homer. you did it, Homer. If they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken. Oh, Homer, I am so proud of you. Proud? Proud of what? Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off guard by that little "mm-mmm" in the road. Ah, what a great family, but come on. We all know this is small potatoes. There's a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together. What, Dad? I'm talking about that. You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses. Wow. Gee, Dad's a hero. What'd ya say, son? Nothin'. That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say. He also brought you the speed bump, the dip sign, the 15 miles per hour speed limit on Main Street. I give you the man whose very name is synonymous with safety. Homer Simpson! Homer! Homer! Thank you. Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing... and especially carelessness wherever they occur. Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Ah, haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he? That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence. Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now. But Mr. Burns-- I said do it! Now do it! Do it! Do it! Our lives are at the hands of men no smarter than you or I, many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I worked alongside them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks! Hey. Hey, Simpson, Burns wants to talk to you privately. Privately? Yes. Stay here. I'll be right back. Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet. Same here. Simpson, I want you to rejoin our power plant family. Sorry. No can do. Hear me out, Simpson! I don't want you to come back as a technical supervisor or supervising technician... or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant. Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about. The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly... 30 seconds, Simpson. Me, in charge of safety? This place could blow sky high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I-- Simpson, time's up. Mmm, what the hey. I'll take the job. Excellent. Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony... and tell that crowd this plant is safe. What? Go on, Homer. Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Yeah, Homer! Go, Dad! Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is-- Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back. I can't do it, Mr. Burns. You mean, you're willing to give up a good job and a raise... just for your principles? Mmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far fetched, but that's the lug you're lookin' at! And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have... crusading for safety! Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job. Mmm. You're not as stupid as you look or sound... or our best testing indicates. You've got the job. Now get to work! I'll get to work, but first I have to say good-bye to some friends. Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog... so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes... or blow yourselves up. But you can't depend on me all your life. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us, and I'm going to have to live without your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is... I'm going to be leaving you. But don't worry. I have just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant... with a big, fat raise! Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad, watch out! Whoa, easy! Don't drop me. Be careful. Homer! Homer! Homer! Shh.
#01x04^Aah! Ooh! Yeah. Oh, yeah? Lisa: Yeah. Yeah! Yeah? Oh, yeah? Yeah. Hey, what's the problem here? We were fighting over which one of us loves you more. You were? Aw, well, go ahead. you love him more. No, you do. No, I don't. Yes, you do! You better get this out of your system right now! I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic. Mmm. Marshmallow. Homer! I'm tying to get the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic. Are you sure that's enough? The boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts. Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it... once. That's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word "bonehead." There it is, kids! Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on Earth. Okay, now look, my boss is gonna be at this picnic. I want you to show your father some love and/or respect. Tough choice. I'm picking respect. Good to see you. Glad you could make it. Oh, Thank you, Mr. Burns. I'm so glad you invited us. Not me. I had to miss little league for this. Quiet, Tom. Oh, please, don't fight. Just go out back and have a good time. Fire that man, Smithers. I don't want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic. He'll be gone by the tug-of-war, sir. Excellent. Uh, afternoon, Mr. Burns. Uh, hello, there, uh-- uh-- Simpson, Homer. Here you go, sir. Ah! Oh, yes. Uh, oh, and this must be your lovely wife, Marge. Oh, and look at little, uh, Lisa. Why, she's growing like a weed. And this must be, uh, Brat. Bart. Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, boss, look what we brought-- gelatin desserts. Oh, for the love of Peter. That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there. And... make yourselves at home. Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself. Now, you listen to me-- Trouble, Simpson? No. just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man. Now remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family. Hey, Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg! D-oh! Be normal. Be normal! Mmm! What an adorable little girl. Thank you. Why don't we dump them in the nursery and get a glass of punch? Oh, I'm not much of a drinker. Hey, isn't that your boy there torturing the swans? Bart! Maybe I will take you up on that punch. Gee, do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised? You're right. There. Bart! Lisa! Where are you kids? D-oh! Whoops. Got ya! Careful. Blow a gasket, lose your job. The father/son-sack race... will begin in five minutes on the north lawn. Participation is mandatory. Repeat, mandatory. That is all. you remember the rules? Shut my mouth, and let your boss win. Hey! I don't know who to love more: my son, Joshua, who's captain of the football team, : Or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A's this term. What's a mother to do? Mm-hmm. Well, I sense greatness in my family. Your family? Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there. And if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a little "al-key-hol" in this punch. Mr. Burns, are you ready? Yes. Are you set? Yes. Go, Mr. Burns. Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it! Bart, no! No! No! No! Oh, no, wait. Oh, no. Bart, don't. Don't. No! Close one this year. Here we sit enjoying the shade Hey, brother, pour on the wine Drink the drink that I have made Hey, brother, pour on the wine He's here at last my one and only Good-bye friends And don't be lonely Hey, brother, pour on the wine Marge, I need you! Hey, Homie, did you try the punch? Snap out of it, Marge. You've gotta come with me. The boss is going to make a toast. Well, I'm not much of a drinker. Why, you picked a perfect time to start. Musicians, cease that infernal tootling. "Thank you all..." uh,"for coming." Marge, knock it off. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Marge! "But now it's time to say good-bye. Please get off my property until next year." I suggest you don't dawdle. The hounds will be released in ten minutes. Did you have a good time, son? Yeah, thanks, Pop. Aw, that's the kind of family unity I like to see. Smithers. Yes, sir? Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant. Quick, Bart, give me a kiss. Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid. Bart, please? Five bucks for a kiss. I have never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor. Fabulous observation, sir. Just fabulous. Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal. What do you mean? Aw, come on. That cornball routine? "I love you, Daddy." Give me a break. I pity you. Why? After you. Thank you so much. Me first! No, me. Me. Me. No, me. No, me. Me. Me. Honey, you look so tired. Would you like me to drive? Oh, Homie, I think I'm going to be sick. There was a farmer who had a dog And Bingo was his name Oh B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o and Bingo was his name, oh Homie, get in the car. This is where you belong. Yeah, Homer. Room for one more. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o The father of the family has worked all day... to find this food for his children. Unable to fend for themselves, the baby bald eaglets... are dependent on their mother regurgitating food which she has found. Hey! Look, everybody. Yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. Tonight, we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family. Happy, Dad? Yes. Good. Commence shoveling. No. We're going to say grace first. Okay. Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub. No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Can the chatter, and bow your heads. Dear Lord, Thank you for this microwave bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions. Pardon my French, but the Y act like savages. Did you see them at the picnic? Of course you did. You're everywhere. You're "omnivorous." O Lord, why did you smite me with this family? Amen! Let's eat. No, I'm not done yet! But, Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here... and listen to you bad-mouth us to the Man Upstairs? I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town. Maybe we should move to a larger community. D-oh! Don't have a cow, Dad. The sad truth is, all families are like us. You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me. Look at that, kids. No fighting. No yelling. No belching. The dad has his shirt on. Look, napkins! These people are obviously freaks. Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind door number two. What are they doing? They're having a conversation. The Y actually enjoy talking to each other. I wish I could hear what they're saying. Papa, I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes. Hmm. I did too. Better get the gun. Where's he going? Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers. Whoa, look at this place. What a dump! It's worse than you think. I just trampled this poor sap's flower bed. Homer, this is our house. Aaah! Are you coming in, Homer? No, no. I wanna be alone with my thought. Fans are getting a bit anxious here. Another beer, Moe. What's-a matter, Homer? Bloodiest fight of the year. You're sitting there like a thirsty bump on a log. Eddie. Evening, Moe. Want some pretzels? No, thanks. We're on duty. A couple beers would be nice, though. Two bucks, boys. Just kidding. Good one, Moe. We're looking for a family of Peeping Toms... who's been terrorizing the neighborhood. Quiet, boy. Let the nice people enjoy their beers. Ah, don't worry. This dog has the scent. What's gotten into Bobo? I got some wieners in my pocket. That figures. Come on, you stupid dog. You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said," Homer, you're a big disappointment." And God bless her soul, she was really on to something. Don't blame yourself, Homer. You got dealt a bad hand. You got crummy little kids that nobody can control. You can't talk that way about my kids! Or at least two of them. Why, you got two I haven't met? Why, you-- Here's five you haven't met. A tremendous right. That's gotta hurt. This fight is over! All-Star Boxing is brought to you by... Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Huh? What? Honey, aren't you going to work today? Oh, I don't think so. Honey, you have a problem, and it won't get better till you admit it. I admit this: You better shut your big yap. Oh, you shut up. No, you shut up! No, you shut up! Shut up! Why don't you both shut up? Hi, friends. I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe. Does this scene look familiar? If so, I can help. No gimmicks. No pills. No faddiets. Just family bliss, or double your money back. So call today. Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Why don't you call right now? When will I learn? The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. They're on TV! All right, time for a family meeting. Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV? Now look, you know and I know this family needs help, professional help. So I've made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe. The fat guy on TV? You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling? Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference. Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do? Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study, and of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is $250. We don't have that kind of money. Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund. Hey! Oh, Homer. Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off chance that they'll actually get in some place? Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents. That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years? I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship. We're not licked yet. To save this family, we're going to have to make the supreme sacrifice. No, Dad. Please don't pawn the TV. Oh, come on, Dad, anything but that. Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead? Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need $150 here! Afternoon, Simpson. What can I do for ya? Would you pay $150 for this lovely Motorola? Is it cable ready? Ready as she'll ever be. Mister, you got yourself a deal. All our money, the college funds, the TV. Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you. Hey, no pain, no gain. Will you be paying by cash or check? Cash, of course. I've got $250 right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. 250 big ones. If you really want to impress her, show her the big, empty space where our TV used to be. Bart! Come on, family. Let's go celebrate our newfound ability to express love. I'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes. Yea! There go my young-girl dreams of Vassar. Hello, I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe. No doubt you recognize me from TV. We would if we had one. Lisa! No, no, Homer, don't stifle the youngster. Your family must feel free to express itself. That's what these pads and jumbo markers are for. I want you to draw for me your fears, your anxieties, the roots of your unhappiness. Take a deep, cleansing breath. And begin. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. No surprises here. Homer? Homer, what have you got for us? Homer? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. If you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you... as a rather stern authority figure, an ogre, if you will. Now, Doctor, that's not true. Ogre is such a strong word. Right on, Doc! Another successful diagnosis. That does it! Whoa! Okay, you wanna kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets. Good idea. All right. I don't know. Okay. Let's take another deep, cleansing breath. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point? They'd work much better without the padding, Doc. No, no. That's not true. Ah! Give me that. See? Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment. Are we cured yet? Don't be ridiculous. You will be, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods. Unortho-what? Don't worry. I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the... electric generator. Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you... for a very important reason, i.e., you are wired into the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock-- just testing. Why, you-- No, Homer, not yet. This is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically. And gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer? Oh, yes, Doctor. Whoa! Aaah! How could you shock your little sister? My finger slipped. So did mine. Aaaah! Bart, Lisa, stop that. No, no. Now, wait a minute. Wait! Wait! Folks, if I could-- This is not the way to get healthy! No! You don't understand, Simpsons! People, please! Boy. Someone's really gobbling up the juice, sir. Excellent. Excellent. Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo. No! No! Simpsons! Son of a-- Stop! Dr. Monroe, your other patients have fled the building. Stop! You're damaging the equipment. Nice hair, Mom. I thought we were making real progress. No, I'm sorry, you're not! You've just got to go. Wait a minute, Doc, your TV commercial said, family bliss or double our money back. Oh, but that was just-- All right. Get the money. 20,40,60,80,1.20,40,60,80,2. 20,40,60,80,3. 20,40,60,80,4. 20,40,60,80,500. Just go, and never tell anyone you were here! Wow, 500 smackers. Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise. It's not the money, as much as the feeling that we earned it. You did it, Dad. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back? That piece of junk? Forget it. We're gonna get a new TV. Twenty-one inch screen, realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays. Yea! Oh, Homer, we love you.
#01x05^Do I smell cupcakes? Ooh! Do I ever! Uh-uh, Homer. Lisa's making these for her teacher. Ah. Say no more. Yum! Don't mind if I do. Bart! Oh, man! Keep your greasy mitts outta there. These are for Lisa's class. It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday. you know, there are names for people like you. No, there aren't. Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser-- Bart! You're saying "buttkisser" like it's a bad thing. Huh? Well, you see, boy, it never hurts to grease the wheels a little. I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher. Sure, Lis. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there. Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard. Yeah, right, Lisa. It's the three roads to success, Bart: Work, brains and hmm-- Oh, brother. Uh-oh, school bus. Gotta go. Heh-heh-heh. Doh! Yo, Ottoman! Yo, Bart dude! Hey, can you believe it, man? My sister here made a whole pile up cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and she won't give anybody else even one measly little crumb. That's bad news, man. Here, Otto. I made an extra one for you. Oh, thanks, little lady. You're welcome. Whoa! Better let me hold these, Lis. Forget it. you sniveling toad! you little egg sucker! Tell me more. Back-scratcher. Foot-licker. Honor student! You'll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller. All right, all right. Look, I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean. you weren't thinking, were you? No. I'm not a sniveling toad, am I? Not really. I'm not a little egg sucker, am I? Of course not. Then what am I? A beautiful human being. What do you like best about me? Well, I'd have to say... your generous nature, your spirit of giving. Well-- Open your mouth and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise. Ahh! Thanks, Lis. You're the best. Look, Janey. Cupcakes. Ah, give me that! Hey, give those back! Hey, what's the big idea? That's my sister, man. So what? So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off. Don't, Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz! Ooh! Ooh! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! Wha-- Nelson, you're bleeding. Nah, happens all the time. Somebody else's blood splatters on me. Hey, wait a minute. You're right. You made me bleed my own blood! It was an accident, man. A terrible, ghastly mistake. Ask anybody. Uh-oh. A cold wind. Hello, kids. Everything above the board here? Good. Play friendly, children. Uh-oh, there's your bell. Come along, now, all of you. No dawdling, now. I'll get you after school, man. But-- No, no, no. He'll get you after school, son. Now hurry up. It's time for class. But-- Scoot, young Simpson. There's learning afoot. Okay, Nelson, put up your dukes! Whaa! Yikes! Uh-uh-uh! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Oh. Aah! Uh-oh. Stop! Mmm! Lunchtime! Ha, ha, ha! Lunchtime! Aah! Lunchtime, Bart. It's lunchtime. I ain't gonna get out of the fourth grade alive. You've gotta tell Principal Skinner, Bart. I can't squeal. It would violate the code of the schoolyard. Hey, everybody! Here comes my brother, Bart the bully-killer! Yeah! You're our hero, Bart! Look, everybody. I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. I'm not sayin' I'm not a hero. I'm just saying that I fear for my safety. Look out! Nelson, it was all a mistake. This is how it happened, man. Listen up. You may get a kick out of it. My sister was making cupcakes this morning and-- I'll see you at the flagpole at 3:15. And you better be prompt. He has four other beatings scheduled this afternoon. Good-bye, little dude. He looks so lifelike, man. Yes. The school nurse did a wonderful job... reconstructing his little face after the fight. Good-bye, son. I guess you were right. All that homework was a waste of your time. Thanks, Bart. We got the day off from school for this. Yeah, and I got the day off from work. Homer! Who wants a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again? Oh, Bart! Oh, Bart! That's better, Homer. Be brave. Bye-bye, Bart. You were always my special little guy. Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. I can't help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. I know you can't eat it now, so I'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. Hey, look. They got food at this thing. Here's one for the road, dude. Aah! Put 'em up. Oh! Boy, you sure taught me a lesson. Whoo. Thanks, guys. I guess now all that's left is a hearty handshake. Right, guys? I'm gonna get you again tomorrow, Simpson. Is 3:15 good for you? Uh, not really. Too bad. Oh, no. Oh, man, that guy's tough to love. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Tough day at school, boy? Bart, what happened to you? Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister. So, you had a little scuffle, eh? Heh-heh. Hope you won. I'm gonna miss you, big guy. Bart, your mother has the fool idea... that you're upset about something. Dad, I need help. Please. Oh. Now come on, Bart. We don't want your mother to see you crying. Here. Oh, man. Let me help you dy those tears. So what's the problem, son? I had a run-in with a bully. A bully? Come on, Marge! I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa. Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this. I guess I could do that. What? And violate the code of the schoolyard? I'd rather Bart died. What on earth are you talking about, Homer? The code of the schoolyard, Marge. The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see. Don't tattle. Always make fun of those different from you. Never say anything... unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do. What else? Homer, that's ridiculous. Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding? What do you mean, Mom? Yeah, right. This oughta be good for a laugh. Shh! This bully friend of yours, is he a little on the chunky side? Yeah, he's pretty chunkified, all right. Mm-hmm. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies, either. No, he's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am. That's why he lashes out at the world. Oh, Marge. So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go. Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy. Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff. No, no! Not like that! Like this! See that, boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he. You mean I should fight dirty, Dad? Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons... sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own. Amen. So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes! And then you sock him when he's staggerin' around blinded! Yeah! And there's nothing wrong... with hitting someone when his back is turned. Gotcha. And if you get the chance, get him right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations. Thanks, Pop. Whoa! Put 'em up! Ha! Ooh! Remember the family jewels, son. Hmm? Oh, no, boys. Not the can, please. Doh! Bart, you can't go on like this. I know. Why don't you go see Grandpa? What can he do? He'll give you good advice. He's the toughest Simpson alive. He is? Yeah. Remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home? Remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home? I'm here to see Grandpa. Half the people here are named Grandpa. Well, Grandpa Simpson then. Second floor, third dank room on the left. Thanks, lady. "Dear Advertisers," I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television. We are not all vibrant, fun-loving s*x maniacs. Many of us are bitter, resentful individuals... who remember the good old days... when entertainment was bland and inoffensive. The following is a list of words... I never want to hear on television again. Number one: bra. Number two: horny. "Number three: Family jewels." Hi, Grandpa! Bart, what brings you here? I need some advice, Grandpa. See, there's this bully at school who keeps beating me up. Let me tell you somethin', boy. If you don't stand up for yourself, bullies are gonna be pickin' on you for the rest of your life. Simpson, give me your newspaper! Why should I? I wanna do the crossword puzzle. No, I want to do the crossword puzzle! I said, give me that puzzle. No. Give me! Give me! No! No! Heh-heh-heh. Well, I guess I can't help you, but I know someone who can. Here? Yep, this is it. What's the password? Let me in, you idiot! Yeah, right you are. So, Herman, has the large-type edition... of this month's Soldier Of Fortune come in yet? No, not yet. Can I interest you in some authentic Nazi underpants? No! Actually, we came over because I want you to meet my grandson, Bart. Ah. Hello, young American. Hello, sir. Uh, Mr. Herman? Yes? Did you lose your arm in the war? My arm? Well, let me put it this way. Next time your teacher tells you to keep your arm inside the bus window, you do it! Yes, sir, I will. Bart's got a problem with a local young bully named Nelson. I thought you could help him with some kind of strategy. Strategy. Hmm. How many men do you have? None. You'll need more. And you'll need to train them hard! Now, let's see. Ah. Okay. The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street. The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians knew it. Now you know it. First you'll need a declaration of war. Uh, ah! That way, everything you do will be nice and legal. Okay, I can use this one from the Franco-Prussian War. I'll just change "Otto von Bismarck" to read " Bart Simpson." Psst! Grandpa, I think this guy's a little nuts. Oh, yeah? Well, General George S. Patton was a little nuts. And this guy is completely out of his mind. We can't fail! Psst! Pass it on! So, Mister, what are we doin' here anyway? I wonder where Bart is. Yeah. It's way past 1500 hours. Okay, we all know why we're here, right? No. Why? To fight Nelson the bully. That guy has been tormenting all of us for years, and I for one am sick of it. I can't promise you victory. I can't promise you good times. But the one thing I do know-- Whoa, whoa! All right! Okay! I promise you victory! I promise you good times! I got a "B" in arithmetic. I got a "B" in arithmetic. Would've got an "A" but I was sick. Would've got an "A" but I was sick. Aah! We are rubber you are glue. We are rubber you are glue. It bounces off of us and sticks to you It bounces off of us and sticks to you Sound off One, two Sound off Three, four Go! Go! What's the matter with you, soldier? It's my nerves, sir. I just can't stand the barking anymore. Your nerves? I won't have cowards in my army. Ow! Sorry, Bart. You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff, you can send 'em off to die on some godforsaken rock, but for some reason, you can't slap 'em. Now apologize to that boy right now. Sorry, man. It's cool. In English class I did the best In English class I did the best Because I cheated on the test Because I cheated on the test Sound off One, two I can't hear you! Three, four All right, there's your enemy. Now hit him! Hit him! Let's go, next group. Martinez! Steinberg! O'Hara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman! Die! Die! We are happy We are merry We are happy We are merry We got a rhyming dictionary We got a rhyming dictionary Sound off One, two One more time! Three, four Bring it on home now! One, two, three, four One, two, three, four Nelson's at the Elm Street Video Arcade. Intelligence indicates he shakes down kids for quarters at the arcade. Then he heads to the Quick-E-Mart for a cherry Squishy. Then that's where we'll hit him. When he leaves the Quick-E-Mart, we start the saturation bombing. We got the water balloons? Two hundred rounds, sir. Is it okay if they say "Happy Birthday" on the side? Well, I'd rather they say " Death From Above," but I guess we're stuck. Okay, our main force will be split into two groups. One will circle around this way to cut off the enemy's retreat, the other will drive in this way, closing the trap. It's a classic pincers movement. It can't fail against a ten-year-old. Heh-heh! Nelson's at the arcade, General. Battle stations. I feel so alive! you know, I thought I was too old. I thought my time had passed. I thought I'd never hear the screams of pain... or see the look of terror in a young man's eyes. Thank heaven for children. Hey, good Squishies. What flavor did you get? Blue. Hey, you two birds! You're gonna be suckin' all your meals through straws if you don't shut your traps. Well, looky here. Little Bart Simpson. Nelson, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson. Ha! Oh, yeah? You and what army? This one. Artillery, commence saturation bombing! Hey! All right, you kids! Keep it down! Am I making myself-- Heh-heh-heh! Got him! You, up in the tree. The tall gray-haired kid. Get your butt down here right now! Doh! No! Please! Don't hurt us! Oh, we surrender. W-W-We were only followin' orders! Eww! Knock it off! I guess you learned your lesson, so now I'll untie you. The second you untie me, I'm gonna beat you to death, man. Well, if that's gonna be your attitude, I'm not gonna untie you. Ha! You're gonna have to sometime. Uh-oh. He's right. Don't you worry. I was ready for this little eventuality. Armistice treaty, article four. "Nelson is never again to raise his fists in anger." Article five. "Nelson recognizes Bart's right to exist." Article six. "Although Nelson shall have no official power, he shall remain a figurehead of menace in the neighborhood." Wow. Sounds good to me. Okay, I'll sign. What about you, boy? All right, I'll sign. Are you boys through playing war? Yes, Mrs. Simpson. Good. Then here's some cupcakes. Oh, boy! Cupcakes. Mmm! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners. Only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War I, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library-- many of them with cool, goy pictures. Well, good night, everybody. Peace, man. Shh!
#01x06^Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa! Sorry, Dad. Women and children first. What the-- Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on. I'm late for work. Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck. Did you check the den? The den! Great idea. Warm. No, cold. Colder. Ice cold. Huh? Do you know where my keys are? No. I'm talkin' about your breakfast. Did you try the rumpus room? Rumpus room? Great idea. Oh, Dad. Huh? Doh! Oh, Homer. Here. I'm sorry, everybody, but I've only got two cupcakes for the three of you. Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to-- Bart! just take mine. A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure. Oh, yeah! All right! All right, class. From the top. One, and two, and three, and-- My county, 'tis of thee La da da da da dee Lisa! Lisa Simpson! Lisa, there's no room for crazy bebop in " My County 'Tis of thee." But Mr. Largo, that's what my county's all about. What? I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of it's car. The lowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up-- That's all fine and good, but none of those unpleasant people... are going to be at the recital next week. Now, class. From the top. Five, six, seven. Every day at noon a bell rings, and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable-- Food fight! Come on, Lis! What are you waiting for? Chuck that spaghetti. I choose not to participate. Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of it's path. In other words, to dodge the ball. Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls. I'm too sad. Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm. Play ball! Come on, come on. Let's go. In the red trunks, with a record of 48 wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson! Whoopee, whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and 48 defeats-- Oh, correction. Humiliating defeats, -all of them by knockout-- Must you do this every time? Homer "The Human Punching Bag" Simpson! Doh! Stupid joystick! Three seconds, folks. A new record. Hey, no. I'm not down. I'm-- Getup, you! Get off the mat. Okay. Here we go. Yo, chump, you back again? Get outta the way! How come he's not ducking? Wait a minute. I can't get my-- Get out of the way, stupid! Homer? Not now, Marge! Get out of the corner! They sent a note from school. What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oops, get outta the way! I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything. No, Bart. This note isn't about you. It isn't? There must be some mistake. Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa. Lisa? She doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes. It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand. Oh, sure, I would, princess. I have feelings too. You know, like, " My stomach hurts." Or "I'm going crazy!" Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it. I'm just wondering what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world? Well, I-- Uh-- Come on, Lisa. Ride the Homer horsey! Giddyap. Whee! Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath. That helps me when I feel sad. Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well. Thanks for knowing I mean well. Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands. Yeah, right. Uh, Bart, vacuum this floor. Hey, man. I didn't do anything wrong! In times of trouble you've got to go with what you know. Now, hop to it, boy! Thinks he's some big stupid Homer. Oh, man. I'll show him. He thinks he's so big. Enjoy your bath? No, not really. Oh, too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub. So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself. Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side anyway. Is not. Is not. Is too. Is too. Is not. Is too! Watch. I'll prove it. Maggie. Come to the one you love best. No, Maggie. Come here, girl. Come tome. Come on, Maggie! The choice is obvious. No, Maggie. Don't go for the glitter. Look for substance. All right, Maggie, just go to Bart. Exactly. Come to the one you love best. Oh, no! Come on! Don't let the-- Aaah! Oh, no, not again. Get over to the-- Aaah! Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this. I am not. It's just that I... couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa. Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that sax-a-ma-thing in the house? I was just playing the blues, Dad. Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead. Play your blues if it'll make you happy. No. That's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you. Let's hear it. You just clack as loud as you want, Lis. I've gotta find that sound. That was beautiful. What's it called? Oh, it's a little tune that I call... the "I Never Had an ltalian Suit Blues." Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on, because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile. What the-- Put up your dukes, Homer. Bart, go easy on me. I'm your dad. I am going easy on you, but you're so old and slow... and weak and pathetic. No! Bart, no! Homer, wake up, wake up. Huh? Oh, man. Here, let me wipe off the drool. You know, Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life was when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So, why are you still awake? I'm still tying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know. Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention. But all the while, our little Lisa is becoming a young woman. Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing. Mmm. Good night, Homer. Now, now low b-flat. Okay, Lisa. "Altissimo" register. Very nice. Very nice. I once ruptured myself doin' that. Thanks, Mr. Murphy. My friends call me Bleedin' Gums. Eww. How'd you get a name like that? Well, let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist? Yeah. Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is. I have problems too. Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul. But I can jam with you. Okay. Oh, I'm so lonely Since my baby left me I got no money And nothing is free Oh, I been so lonely Since the day I was born All I got is this rusty This rusty old horn I got a bratty brother He bugs me every day And this morning my own mother She gave my last cupcake away My dad acts like he belongs He belongs in the zoo I'm the saddest kid In grade number two you know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems. Yeah, but I don't feel any better. The blues isn't about feelin' better. It's about makin' other people feel worse and makin' a few bucks while you're at it. Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing in a little club called the jazz Hole. Lisa! Get away from that jazzman! But Mom! Can't I stay a little longer? Come on. We were worried about you. Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar. Today's fire raced through downtown Springfield, gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts Center and Barney's Bowl-a-rama. Officials said the-- Oh, no! Marge! Marge, are you all right? No! I'm very upset. Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we gonna do? The lanes were kinda warped, but, oh, the food. I'm upset about Lisa. Oh, me too. Me three. What are we talking about? Bart! Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart? Oh, yeah, easy. you do love her, don't you? Oh, Mom. Well, you do. Don't you? Don't make me say it. I know the answer. You know the answer. He knows the answer. Let's just drop it. Okay? Okay, Bart. You don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister. Okey-dokey. Go on, Bart. No time like the present. Hi, man. I don't want your pity. Aw, come on. I'll cheer you up. How? Yeah. Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking. Is Jacques there? Who? Jacques. Last name Strap. Uh, hold on. Uh, Jacques Strap? Hey, guys, I'm lookin' for a Jacques Strap. What? Aw, wait a minute. Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it, you cowardly little runt! When I get a hold of you, I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood. Where's your sense of humor, man? Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go. Uh, give me some quarters. I'm doing my laundry. Yeah. Right. Where's the video boxing? It's over there in the corner. If I were you I really would use those quarters for laundry. Wise guy. Hey, that kid's pretty good. Good? Are you kidding? Over 2.000 fights, and he's still on his original quarter. Okay, who's next? Me, me, me, me, me! No, me! Listen, can you teach me to fight like you do? I don't think so. Oh, come on. I'll tell you what. I'll do it if you bark like a dog. You little-- you got yourself a deal, Fido. Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man. That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm gonna pound the tar out of... a certain little smarty-pants tonight. Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money... in this stupid place! Sorry, Mom. And you! A man of your age. You should be ashamed of yourself. Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling. Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today. But I don't feel like smiling. Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down. All the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you, and happiness will follow. Oh, come on. You can do better than that. Oh, that's my girl. I feel more popular already. Hey, uh, nice smile. Thanks. Hey, what are you talkin' to her for? She's just gonna say somethin' weird. Not me. you know, I used to think you were some brainiac, but I guess you're okay. Uh-huh. Hey, why don't you come over to my house after practice? you could do my homework. Okay. Mmm. Five minutes, people. Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat... of yesterday's out burst of unbridled creativity. No, sir. Wow, Mom! Hmm. So that's where she gets it. Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You wanna be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us. Okay, Mom. I said you could stop smiling, Lisa. I feel like smiling. I'm gonna knock you out one more time, and that's it. This is getting boring, man. Just ty not to kill me too hard, son. Whoa! Kid, tonight's not your night. All right, man, you asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Aha! Blocked it. You missed me. Oh! I got you. Ooh. Don't try that. I got you blocked. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill! Boys, I'd like your attention, please. Quiet, Marge! This is my big moment! Bart "The Bloody Pulp" Simpson is on the ropes. He is hoping I'll put him out of his misery! Well, you're in luck, Bart! Here comes my right! Oh, no! My game, my game! I could have beat the boy. Marge, how could you? I was so close. I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game. You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing. Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks... would be fun for the whole family. The next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz. I got this bratty brother He bugs me every day And this mornin' my own mother Gave my last cupcake away My dad acts like he belongs, y'all He belongs in the zoo What? I'm the saddest kid In grade number two
#01x07^Man! Rusty old hunk of junk! Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya? Shut up, Flanders. Hey, Dad, how come we can't get a decent mower, like the Flanders have? Just be happy with what you've got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanders'. Whoa! How do you like my new wheels, Simpson? Oh, wow, man! What an RV! Bart! Uh, I suppose it has, uh, various features. Oh, it's got everything-- microwave, dish washer, big screen TV, deep fryer and, oh, see up there on the roof? A satellite dish! Yes, indeedly-doodly. But, uh, how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while, and you make only $27 a week more than I do. Oh, it's simple, Simpson. Credit. Ooh, credit! Hmm! Mmm! Oh! Ah! Thank you, God. May I help you? We're just browsing. Thank you. I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth? Yes we do. That would be the Ultimate Behemoth. Where is it? You are standing in its presence. Behold! Oh, wow! Would you look at this thing? Man built this. It's a vehicle. Does it have its own satellite dish, sir? You can tell your son it has its own satellite. The Van Star One, launched last February, just for this thing, that's all. Whoa, man! I'm not sure that we can afford-- Does it have a deep fryer? It has four of them-- one for each part of the chicken. I don't think we can afford this. Let's worry about that later. Come on. Let's take a tour. Want to? Come on Ay, caramba. This is better than our house. Wait till Flanders gets a load of this. Seems so expensive. Hey! How much is it? Oh. You're a man of your convict-- You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out, didn't ya? Yeah. How much is it? Well, first of all, I want you to know I like your face. You do? I really do. I'm not saying that. I mean it. You got color in there. You're not Roman, are you? No! Look like a god, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? Hey, your dad's gonna just go in here, work it out and you'll, you'll drive home in this! I'm not gonna quote you a price till I check your credit rating. And let me-- I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, " Bob, is this guy good for it?" I say,"Yes." I don't check this machine, but I don't own the place, even though my name's up there. Long story, but that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer. Is that a good siren? Am I approved? You ever known a siren to be good? No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind, telling me, "Sell the vehicle to this fella, and you're out of business." That's what the siren says. Oh. Seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And "weebit" is me bein' polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million. Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't wanna go away empty-handed, Bob. Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm gettin' from ya. Perhaps I can show you something, uh... a little more you. Well, what do you think? You gotta be kidding me. Used, isn't it? What'd you say? Uh, is it used? Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally. This is it for you, you know? It's this or a wagon. Then... uh, how much do you want for it? This is yours. You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you. Someone else, I'm doublin' this. I swear it, Bob. This is you and me. Yeah. Two months from now, your head's in that window. On my honor. 350 a month. Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be all right if I conferred with my family? Mr. Simpson, if you have to talk it over with those humans out there, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man able to make a decision. See that man over there? Yeah. He's buying this. Did you know that? Called me, said, "Save the little one. I'm coming." Here he is. Now you want it or not? All right, all right. I'll take it! Best decision you ever made. You are gonna-- You are gonna-- This is gonna change your life. Hey, Flanders. Look what I got. Oh, she's a beaut! Hey, congratulations! I'm sure you'll have loads of fun. Jealous. Everybody ready? I hate this. I don't wanna go. That's the spirit. Ready or not, nature, here we come! Turkey farm, skunks, slaughterhouse? No, no, no. What are you doing back there? We're playing,"What's that odor?" Dad's feet? Bart! You win, Bart. Lisa! Are we there yet, Dad? I'll tell you when. Go back to your smell game. Homer, I'm telling you. This is not the interstate. Maps. Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions? Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle. My feet are getting wet! Oh, come on. We're getting back to nature. Mom, I'm scared. We all are, dear. Your father says there's nothing to worry about. What do you think? Should we stop here? Yes! All righty. Well, here we are. Okay, nobody move, and nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone, ever so slowly, open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One-- The Simpsons have entered the forest. Well, ha, ha. Now we get a chance to be real pioneers. Yes, sir. This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for this. You mean, like we just did? Will somebody help her? Look, Maggie. Birdies. Oh, Homer, what are we going to do? Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting. I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here while I go over this way and try to get my bearings. What am I gonna do? I've murdered us all! I've murdered us all! I've murdered us all! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! D-oh! D-oh! D-oh! There. Finished. You are? Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter. It is? Uh-huh. Okay. We'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax. Remember, the handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star. That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods. Should Maggie be going with them? I don't think they'll be gone long, and she's in good hands. There aren't any dangerous animals... in the forest, are there, Dad? Might be a few, but don't worry. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. It's a deal. And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear, and they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of. Right. A rattler! I'm not afraid! Run, you fool! Through here, boy. Back to civilization. How do you know? When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural, like a third sense. The boys certainly are taking a long time. I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much. Bart! Where are you, Bart? His lucky red hat. Oh, dear God! No! Bart! Bart! Bart! Oh, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son! Why couldn't You have taken me? Of all the fates on heaven and earth, why did this one befall me? Don't have a cow, Dad. What the-- D-oh! You're alive! And buck naked. I'm not the only one, Home boy. What? Oh! Jungle man. The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness. Yeah, man. Okay. Slap a fern on there, boy. And now with some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little moss. And some moss for me. All right. Ready to hit the town. But, Dad, I am so hungry! Can't we eat somethin' first? I'm starvin', man. Ah, food. Good thinking, son. This young sapling ought to do the trick. What are we gonna do, hang ourselves? No! This is a trap. It's gonna catch us our dinner. Come on, boy. Shh! just watch. Oooh! A-ha! Got him! Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. And when he comes out, you step on him. Right, Dad. Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Great camping trip, honey. Traveled 800 miles, haven't even seen a squirrel yet. Well, the ranger at the gate said we should watch out for bears. Oh, bears! Mm-hmm. Right, right. Let me show you how many bears there are around here. Uh, hello, bears! Um, come on. Have a donut. Oh, what the heck, have me! Come and get it! All right, all right. You made your point. Bears. I hope Maggie and the boys are all right. Oh, I'm sure they're just fine. After all, we built a fire, and we don't know anything about nature. Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done. Yeah, I suppose so. Good night, Mom. Good night, dear. G-G-Good n-n-night, D-D-Dad. G-G-Good n-n-night, son. Sleep tight. Are we there yet? No! Are we ever gonna be there? How would I know? Quit asking pointless-- Bart, look! Honey. Honey! We're saved! Uh, Homer. Bees? How is it? Tangy. What? Oh, water. That-a-way, man. Bigfoot. The legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend. He's very, very real. What you're about to see is unedited video footage... taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of Tenderfoot George. Now, the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinay pictures... was most impressed with the creature's uncivilized look, it's foul language and, most of all, it's indescribable stench. A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of$5,000... to anyone who brings in the creature alive. Naturally, we'll have more on this story as it develops. We now return you to the president's address already in progress. It looks as if you girls have been getting along all right, but it's a darn good thing we found you when we did. There's something horrible roaming these woods. There is? Why, that's my husband! His name isn't Bigfoot. His name is Homer. What does it eat? I don't understand. What's this all about? Well, I suppose pork chops are his favorite. Get those bears out of here. I'm tying to do an interview. No bears! We're taping! All bears off the set. Okay. Now let's get back to your, uh, husband. How would you describe your marital relations? Brutish? Is this going to be on TV? Coast to coast. just a little further. Are we there yet? Are we there yet? just a little further. Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Food! Nice grizzlies. N-Nice grizzlies. Nice grizzlies. What do we do, Dad? Praise the grizzlies, son. Nice grizzlies. Nice grizzlies. That's a good grizzly. Oh. Oh. Huh? Maggie! Oh, my little girl. Nice grizzlies. Nice grizzlies. Later, grizzly dudes. Look! It's him! It's Bigfoot! Get in the car! Get him! Get him! Huh? We got him! We got Bigfoot! You are darn lucky we got here in time to rescue you. What the hell are you talking about, sir? He's getting away. After him! We gotta take him alive. You got that tranquilizer gun ready? Dad! Oh, Dad! Avenge me, son. Avenge my death. Last week's capture of Bigfoot turned into the scientific poser of the century. Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains, "Who was this Homer?" Was it a man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot? Could I have some applesauce? Specialists gathered at the Springfield Primate lnstitute... for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature. They are now ready to announce their findings. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh, distinguished colleagues, after extensive biological and anatomical testing, I regret to announce that the evidence we have is... inconclusive. This thing may or may not be human. That's what he thinks. I say it's none other than Bigfoot himself. Oh, no. I disagree. I think it is a man. The eyes have the glimmer of human intelligence. Really. Glimmer in the eyes. What about the sloping ape-like forehead? Oh, the guys at work are gonna have a field day with this. Cheer up, Homer. At least they let you go. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Fraulein, please. This much I believe we can agree upon: This specimen is either a below-average human being... or... a brilliant beast. Stupid egghead. Oh, Homer. My brilliant beast. Shh!
#01x08^Now class, I don't want this field trip to be a repeat of our infamous visit... to the Springfield State Prison. So, I want you all to be on your best behavior, especially you, Bart Simpson. Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door. Uh, sorry, little dudes. Party hardy was tardy. All right, children. Count off. One, two, three. Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman. Hey, Bart dude. Any new tattoos, Otto? Oh, funny you should ask, man. This morning I woke up with this one. Cool. I want one. Huh. Not till you're 14, my little friend. Bart! Bart Simpson! Take your seat, Bart. Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride. No offense, Wendell. Oh. Be that as it may, it's the only seat left, so get in there! Please try not to shake the seat like that. Now, class, remember. Do not stick any part of your body out the window. We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck his arm out the window... and had it ripped off by a big truck coming in the other direction. And I was that boy. Uh, Bart Simpson, sit down! I've had just about enough of your tomfoolery. Oh, I don't feel so hot. Look, there's our school again. Otto, are you sure you-- It's a shortcut, Mrs. K. Trust me. Mrs. Krabappel! Mrs. Krabappel! Bart, not another word out of you, or I'll subject you to the humiliation... of making you sing in front of the class. Can I pick the song? No. The song will be "john Henry Was a Steel Drivin' Man." Oh, no. We're gonna make you sing, Bart Simpson. Yeah, Bart Simpson, we're gonna make you sing. That's it, Bart. Oh, why can't you be more like, uh, uh-- Us, Mrs. Krabappel? Yes, Sherri and Terri. They know how to behave. Da, da, da, da, da, da. Whoa! It's a lead-pipe cinch. Here's the kick off. Wolodarsky takes it at the five. And oh, my. He fumbles! Oh, yeah, and every locomotive that comes rollin' by Bart. Bart! Says there lies a steel-drivin' man Lord, Lord, oh, there lies a-- Okay, Bart. Enough! Hey, Wendell, you made it, buddy. And so, this plant harnesses the power of the atom... so that we have the energy to run everything from your favorite video game... to yummy cotton candy machines. Let's learn more about nuclear energy, shall we? Lights. When most people think of nuclear energy, they think of this. But when we talk about nuclear energy, we really mean this. But what exactly is nuclear energy? I don't know, but I know someone who does. Smilin' Joe Fission. Hi, there, energy eaters. I'm Smilin'joe Fission, your atomic tour guide... to the strange and exciting world of nuclear power. And these are rods of uranium 235. Hi, Rod. Hi. Hey. Good to see ya. Hey, you guys look hot. Of course we're hot. We're radioactive. Uh-oh. Well, how 'bout a dip in the pool? Yeah! Last one in's the rotten rod! The rods make the water so hot it boils. Ow! Ouch! Ow! And the steams pins turbines that generate energy. Bart, sit down. Uh-oh. Whoops. Looks like there's a little leftover nuclear waste. No problem. I'll just put it where nobody'll find it for a million years. So, now you know the whole true story of nuclear energy, our no longer misunderstood friend. So, keep on smilin'. Now, let's have even more fun. And, uh, over here is our thermal regulator. To your right, if you look through this window, you'll see where our water rejoins the rest of nature's biosphere. Hey, Bart, our dad says your dad is incompetent. What does incompetent mean? It means he spends more time yakking and scarfing down doughnuts than doing his job. Oh, okay. I thought you were putting him down. You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference... between these doughnuts and ones baked today. My boy's supposed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet? Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around... on your butt and stuffin' your face, they'd take them on a tour of your house. You're right. I gotta get where the action is. Comin' through! Hey, there's my dad. Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer! Woo! Woo! I'm up here! Oh, hi, boy! All right. Who's responsible for this? I might have known it was you, Simpson. But, sir, I-- I don't want to hear about it, Simpson. You're fired! Oh, hi, girls. Hi, Daddy. Here's a good job at the fireworks factory. Those perfectionists? Forget it. How 'bout this? Supervising technician at the toxic waste dump. I'm no supervising technician. I'm a technical supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big, worthless nothing. There, there, Homer. You'll find a job. You've caused plenty of industrial accidents, and you've always bounced back. Yeah, Dad, you can do it! Yeah, go for it, Dad. You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied and I'll take anything! Watch out, Springfield. Here I come. Don't give up, Dad. I'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much. Moe's Tavern. Is Mr. Freely there? Who? Freely. First initials "I.P." Hold on. I'll check. Uh, is I.P.Freely here? Hey, everybody! I.P.Freely! Wait a minute. Listen to me, ya lousy bum. When I get a hold of you, you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half. You'll get that punk someday, Moe. Ah, I don't know. He's tough to catch. He keeps changing his name. Oh, I think I'll have another-- Oops. Oh, I'm a little low on funds. Do you think you can cover me just this once? No, sorry. W-Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation. I don't think you're ever gonna get another job and be able to pay me back. Oh. Don't worry. We're still friends. I fall to pieces All you all right, Homer? I'm fine. I'm just thinking. Well, I've been thinking too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted. You think you can still do that kind of work? Sure. You never forget. It's just like riding a bicycle. Hey, Mama, where's my fries already? Dad, eat something. It's got mustard on it. All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale. I don't know what else to do. There's only one thing we can do: Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad. Loaf time, the cable network for the unemployed. We'll be back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this. Unemployed? Out of work? Sober? You sat around the house all day, but now it's Dufftime. Duff, the beer that makes the days fly by. Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff Duffbeer Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. There must be some beer here somewhere. Ah. Maybe in here. Damn! I need money! Oh, no. What have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute. Let me count and make sure. Not even close. Dear family. I am an utter failure, and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watey grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: "Stand tall, have courage and never give up." I only hope I can provide a better model... in death than I did in life. Warmest regards. Love, Homer J. Simpson. Nothing's easy. Oh, looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself. Well, maybe not. Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk. Oh. Mom! Mom! Wake up! We've been robbed! What? Someone swiped my piggy bank! Your father's gone too! Look what I found. Almost there. Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going! Well, live and learn. There he is! Don't do it, Dad! Boy, this intersection is dangerous. Someone ought to put a stop sign here. Oh, Homer. How could you think of killing yourself? We love you. Yeah, Dad. We love you. Yeah. Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign! Next on the agenda. Police Chief Wiggum... will give us an update on our graffiti problem. Well, it's no secret our city is under siege... by a graffiti vandal known as " El Barto." Police artists have a composite sketch of the culprit. If anyone has any information, please contact us immediately. Cool, man. Tough customer. Ooh, wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley. And now, new business. Homer Simpson, local resident, has something. Mr. Simpson? Don't be nervous. We believe in you, Homer. Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from dinosaurs that tormented our caveman ancestors to the-- Simpson, get to the point. I think we should put a stop sign at " D" Street and 12th. The other-- All in favor? Aye. Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee and maple logs in the lobby. Wow. They listened to me. All right, Dad! Way to go, Homer. you did it, Homer. If they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken. Oh, Homer, I am so proud of you. Proud? Proud of what? Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off guard by that little "mm-mmm" in the road. Ah, what a great family, but come on. We all know this is small potatoes. There's a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together. What, Dad? I'm talking about that. You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses. Wow. Gee, Dad's a hero. What'd ya say, son? Nothin'. That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say. He also brought you the speed bump, the dip sign, the 15 miles per hour speed limit on Main Street. I give you the man whose very name is synonymous with safety. Homer Simpson! Homer! Homer! Thank you. Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing... and especially carelessness wherever they occur. Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Ah, haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he? That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence. Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now. But Mr. Burns-- I said do it! Now do it! Do it! Do it! Our lives are at the hands of men no smarter than you or I, many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I worked alongside them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks! Hey. Hey, Simpson, Burns wants to talk to you privately. Privately? Yes. Stay here. I'll be right back. Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet. Same here. Simpson, I want you to rejoin our power plant family. Sorry. No can do. Hear me out, Simpson! I don't want you to come back as a technical supervisor or supervising technician... or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant. Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about. The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly... 30 seconds, Simpson. Me, in charge of safety? This place could blow sky high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I-- Simpson, time's up. Mmm, what the hey. I'll take the job. Excellent. Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony... and tell that crowd this plant is safe. What? Go on, Homer. Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Yeah, Homer! Go, Dad! Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is-- Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back. I can't do it, Mr. Burns. You mean, you're willing to give up a good job and a raise... just for your principles? Mmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far fetched, but that's the lug you're lookin' at! And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have... crusading for safety! Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job. Mmm. You're not as stupid as you look or sound... or our best testing indicates. You've got the job. Now get to work! I'll get to work, but first I have to say good-bye to some friends. Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog... so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes... or blow yourselves up. But you can't depend on me all your life. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us, and I'm going to have to live without your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is... I'm going to be leaving you. But don't worry. I have just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant... with a big, fat raise! Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad, watch out! Whoa, easy! Don't drop me. Be careful. Homer! Homer! Homer! Shh.
#01x09^Whoops. Whoops. Whoops. This is gonna be the best birthday breakfast Mom ever had. Hey, Lis. You think that's enough for her? Maybe one more. I hope she likes the presents we got her. She'll like mine. Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume all the way from gay Paree? Four bucks, plus tax. I think she's going to like my handmade birthday card better. Oh, big deal. Dry macaroni, spray paint and glue. Whoopie. Dibs. First dibs. I get to lick the beaters. Ow! Ow! Ow! Litha, my "ongue" is "uck" in the "eaters." My "ongue"! Happy birthday! Huh? What? Here's your birthday breakfast. Oh! Isn't this nice? My birthday? It's my birthday? No! What did I get? I love birthdays. No, Homer, it's mine. You don't even know your own wife's birthday? Well, of course I know. Sure. You really thought I forgot, didn't you? Oh, right. What did you get her, Dad? What did you get? Uh, well, a vey thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block. I think he forgot, Mom. Mm-hmm. Oh, no. Come on. Come on. Open up! Good morning, consumers. The Springfield Mall is now open for your spending needs. Hmm? Uh... no. Too salty. Um... nah. Hmm? Nah, too corny. Too exciting. Patty, he's out buying me something right now. Oh, Marge. He never gets anything you want. He always gets something for himself. The tackle box. Remember when he got you the tackle box? And Connie Chung. And when he surprised you with the Connie Chung calendar? I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately. Hmm. Hmm! Well, Homer and I had a lovely dining experience at Chez Pierre. Or the Rusty Barnacle is nice. No, no, no. We wanna take you someplace fun-- The Singing Sirloin. The place where the waiters sing. Homer? Be right there. Homer, we're having dinner tonight at The Singing Sirloin. That sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers. And the kids. Fair enough. And my sisters. Doh! How we danced on the night we were wed Havin' my baby What a lovely way to say how much you love me Nearer my God to thee Nearer to thee Oh, perfume! Whoa! Hmm. Thank you, Bart. You're welcome, Mom. 34 years old. Time enough to start over with a new man. Someone who eats with his mouth shut. What's that, Patty? Nothing. Finish your steak. Look at him wolfdown that gristle. Mm-hmm. It's an accident waiting to happen. Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver? No. Good. I think she likes my present better. Does not. Does not. Does not. Does too. Does too. Then how come she's not putting on any of your perfume? Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not putting on any of my perfume? Mm. Well, I'm saving it for a special occasion. What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it! Bart! But this occasion is already so special. If we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special. Gotcha. Told ya she liked mine better. Oh, brother! Hold on. Hold on now. Your mother hasn't opened my present yet. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy 34th birthday, Mrs. Homer Simpson Happy birthday to you Oh. Don't worry. This frosting will come right off. Beauty, isn't she? It's hard for me to judge since I've never bowled in my life! Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does. You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second, so please, say something back, Marge, please? I'm gonna stop talking... now. You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me. What? No. The holes were drilled for your fingers. I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store. You never intended for me to use that ball. If that's how you feel, I'll take it back. You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it! So you'd know it was from me! Homer, I'm keeping the ball... for myself! What? But you don't know how to bowl. Oops. I'm keeping it, and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer. Well... you're... welcome. Excuse me. Where do I throw this? Over there. Thank you. You're gonna need a lane. No, thanks. I'm here out of spite. Can't bowl without a lane. Well, all right. Here you go. You keep score on this. What size shoes do you wear? Never you mind. You can't wear street shoes on the lanes. You gotta wear bowling shoes. What size, please? 13 double "A." 13 double "A "? This is the closest I've got. A nine and a fifteen. Thank you. Hmm. A little warm and moist. Ugh! Hmm. Hmm. So, 120 pins later, I am the better man. I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing. Hmm. Oh! I'm-- I'm awfully sorry. Entirely my fault. It is nice to meet you, Homer. Oh, no, no. Homer's my... ball's name. I'm Marge. Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They're far too tapered for the ball you're using. You need something lighter. More delicate. Here. Use my ball. No. No, thank you, Mr., um, Brunswick. Call me Jacques. Jacques. Marge. I'll just use my ball. As you wish. Many people have senseless attachments to heavy, clumsy things, such as this Homer of yours. Hmm. May I ask you a bold question? Sure. You've never bowled before. Never. No. No. Then I will teach you. I don't wanna trouble you. Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form. All right. But I'm not vey good. I can hit that one pin all right, but the rest of them don't even wobble. I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up. Oh! Now throw. Throw, damn you. But-- You're a very good teacher. Yes, I am a very good teacher, and I can teach you everything. I can tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean, which frame is the beer frame. I bet you don't know how to make a five-seven-ten split. Do you, Marge? No. But first of all, you yell, "The eight-pin is a cop." Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud. Laugh out loud. You'll lose weight. Oh, that's very funny. Feels good. I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge for lessons? Twenty-five dollars. Twenty-five dollars! It's a $40 value. Well, all right. When do we start? We have already begun. Now this is living, hey, kids? Hot pizza-- the food of kings. Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard takin' care of us. Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this? First, you must get to know your lane. Feel the slickness. Feel the satiny finish. Caress it. Experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it, Marge? Ooh, very smooth. Smooth? Yes? Yes, vey. Yes. Yes. Smooth? Yes. Smooth. Yes. You could eat off of it. You hungry? Yes. Four onion rings! Mmm. Delicioso! My compliments to the delivery boy. We've eaten and eaten well. What else do we have to do? Let's check the list your mom left us. Eat. Mm-hmm. Oh, clean up. Don't worry, everybody. This will be a breeze if we all pitch in. All right! We're clean! Now we'll... put Maggie to bed. Lullaby and good night Go to bed and sleep tight Close your eyes Start to yawn Pleasant dreams until the dawn Homer. Homer? Huh? Oh, how was bowling? It's a very challenging hobby. Sport, dear. It's a sport, you silly thing. Mm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night. You're going back? Sure. If you don't mind taking care of the kids again. Uh, no. I don't mind. Good night, Homer. Good night. It is for you. Oh, Jacques, it fits. You got it in my size, and it has my name on it. It's really for me. Seventeen-fifty. Enjoy it, my darling. Here we are. You didn't have to drop me off. But I wanted to. Marge, do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight? Oh, Jacques. I'm a married woman. I know. I know. My mind says,"Stop," but my heart... and my hips cy," Proceed." Marge, darling, I want to see you tomorrow. Not at Barney's Bowlarama. Away from the thunderous folly of clattering pins. Meet me tomorrow for brunch. What's brunch? You'll love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupee at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal. I don't think so. Marge, darling, there are ten pins in my heart. You've knocked over eight. Won't you please pick up that spare? Mm. Mm. All right! Marge? What, Homer? Nothing. Uh-oh. Schoolbus. Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies... and some treats just for fun. Ay, caramba! Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom? Well, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Here's more treats. Your dad will take care of dinner. Mmm, Wednesday. Hoagie night. Good-bye, Lisa. My darling little Lisa. Good-bye, Bart. My special little guy. Mmm! Great lunches, eh, Lis? Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call overcompensation. Mom is wracked with guilt because her marriage is failing. Hey, don't rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits. Bart, I read about what happens to kids... whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, I'm in stage three, fear. You're in stage two, denial. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I'm not. I'm not. Am not! I stand corrected. Mimosa? I'm a married women. Don't call me that. No, no, no, no, no. Mimosa is the name of the drink. It's orange juice and champagne. You're so wonderful that you thought it was something offensive. Oh, well, thank you. Marge? Marge Simpson. You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the minister. Hello, Helen. I had just finished eating and was about to leave... when I looked over this way and said to myself, "Isn't that Marge Simpson having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?" And I just had to come over and say hello. We're, um-- Oh, don't squirm on my account. I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you. Now, Marge, the pins on the three-seven-ten split would be here. We'll make this little piece of food the ball. The ball's bigger. But for food, this is a good ball. Oh, well, bye-bye. See you in church on Sunday, Marge. Good-bye, Helen. Good-bye, Helen. You have a lovely friend there. Let's hope something runs over her. Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next, I will die, for I am about to say something very serious, perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again, That doesn't shock me. away from pying eyes, away from the Helens of the world, at my apartment-- the Fiesta Terrace. I've been waiting for you. Come in, my captivating one. May I have this dance? Sure. Whoa! You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies. I like you so much. They're not for bowling, Marge. You're so naive. They are for lovemaking. Really? Yes. Oh! Champagne? Please. There, my darling. Thank you. What cosmic force brought us together, Marge? Destiny? Yes. Some divine pinspotter... must have placed us side by side. Like two fragile bowling pins-- Standing bravely-- Until inevitably-- We must topple. Marge, speak to me. Is Thursday okay? It's okay, indeed. "For Marge"? Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around? Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball. Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out. Simpson checks the runner on first. He's cool. He's fine. Here's the windup, and here's the pitch. Dad, you didn't even say "ouch." Oh, sorry. Ouch. Lisa. Lisa, I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here. Frightened, Bart? Welcome to stage three, fear. We gotta do something, man. Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you, but I'm mired in stage five, self-pity. Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help. I gave you advice? Get out of here. Yeah, you did. You told me when something's bothering you... and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way, you won't make things worse. Hmm. Good advice. Marge, may I speak to you? Sure. You know, I've been thinking. Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the side... and the guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it, but it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. Good-bye, my wife. Good-bye, Homer. To the most beautiful moment in life. Better than the deed, better than the memory-- the moment of anticipation. Oh, Jacques, you handsome devil. Look at you. You're really going to strike out tonight! Ain't you hungry, Homer? Starving. Well, then why aren't you eating your sandwich? How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left. Domestic situation. Uh, huh? Marge! What a lovely surprise. You're here to see me, right? Of course! Hey, way to go, Homer. Way to go! What will I tell the boss? Tell him I'm going to the backseat of my car with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes. Shh!
#01x10^So, how was the office birthday party? Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk-- my poor sucker of an assistant-- didn't know the fruit punch was spiked... and he really made an ass of himself... putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance. Does this girl like him? I have to warn you, Marge, I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly. Homer. Just keeping you on your toes, babe. Two hundred and thirty nine pounds! Oh, I'm a blimp. Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning. You're not a blimp, Homer. You're my big cuddly teddy bear. Aw, baloney. Yeah, right. Aw, baloney. Yeah, right. Oh, give me a break. Wow, cool, man! Oh, no! Two hundred and thirty nine pounds? I'm a whale. Why was I cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer. Oh. Don't strain yourself, dear. Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night... I'm gonna be attending a little get together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance. Homer, is this some kind of stag party? No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy. A tea-and-crumpets kind of thing. Eugene Fisk. Isn't he your assistant? No! My supervisor. Didn't he used to be your assistant? What is this, the Spanish lnquisition? Sorry, Homer. Uh-oh, it's the "fe-mailman." Female carrier, Bart. Lady, where's my spy camera? "Where's my spy camera?" Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera, lady? Evey day for the last six months-- Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Here's your stupid spy camera! Oh. Thanks, ma'am. Whoa, man. Look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works. 'Cause I got a lot of spying to do. Bart! What are you doing? Sorry, Dad. The answer to that is top secret. Oh, Bart. What? Go take some wildlife pictures or something. Ew, gross. Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt. Oh, sure. Like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt. Stop it, you two. And put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at The Rusty Barnacle. Yea, fried shrimp! Aw, Mom. Can't we just grab a burger at-- Only four of us? Who escaped? Your father. He's having a boys' night out. Just as I was asking myself, "Where did my seven-year-old boy get the money... for a Father's Day present?" I opened the box. And inside was little Eugene's baseball glove. He had given me the one thing... that mattered most to him in the whole world. Eugene, when I see you-- the one thing that matters most to me in the whole world-- married tomorrow, I'm going to know just how you felt that day. I love you, Dad. I love you, son. Where am I, the planet Cornball? Hey, don't worry. Things are gonna pick up once the entertainment gets here. Ooh, entertainment. Yes, sir. Ahoy! I spy the children's menu. Ahoy, this place bites. Bart. So, what's it gonna be, me little bucko? Hm, let's see. This evening I shall go for the... squid platter, Ew. With extra tentacles, please. Oh, Bart. Excuse me, sir. The party next door seems to be a little raucous. Could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please? Aye, aye. Eh, eh, eh, eh. Hey, try to keep it down, guys. Okay? Hey, shut up. Open the door and lie on the floor said Barnacle Bill the sailor Hmm. Here you go. There you are. For the baby. And one squidplatter, extra tentacles. Bart, quit fooling around and eat your dinner. Yeah, eat it, Bart. Ugh. May I please be excused for a minute? Okay, but don't dawdle. Your food will get cold. Okay, Eugene. One last taste of bachelor freedom. Presenting Princess Kashmir, queen of the mysterious East. Now this is what I call a party. How do I tell you this, my boy? We're in hell. Look at him squirm. You care to dance? She wants you, Homer. Go for it, Homer! Shake his buns. I'm sorry. I don't usually laugh like this. Ai, caramba. Wow, man. Oh, this is the most fun I've ever had in my life. The meeting of the Future Photographers of America is now in session. We would like to welcome our new member, Bart Simpson. Whoa. People, people. Don't applaud. Let's get to work. My goodness. Quite exciting. Extremely sensual. The subtle gray tones recall the work of Helmut Newton. Who's the sexy lady, Bart? Beats me. But the guy dancing with her is my pop. Wow! He brings to mind the later work of Diane Arbus. Bart, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork. Me too. Yeah, come on. Sorry, guys. No can do. Aw. Oh. Come on, Bart. You're gonna make me a print, aren't you? Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo? Okay. Yep. Cross your heart and hope to die? Stick a needle in your eye? Jam a dagger in your thigh? Yep. Yep. Eat a horse manure pie? Yep. Well, okay. Pst. Look what I got. Whoa. I gotta have a copy of that. Sorry. Aw, come on. Well, okay. Hey, Bart. How come Milhouse gets a copy of your girlie picture and I don't? I thought I was your friend too. Well, okay. Son, why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash? Sorry, Dad. Wait till I show the guys at work this little doozy. Mike, this is Al. Just wanted to thank you for the "informative memo" you faxed me. Whoops. Here comes the boss. Gotta go. Reverend Lovejoy, your wife confiscated this... from one of the boys in the choir. Why this sheep has strayed from my own flock. His name's-- Homer Simpson, sir, a low-level employee... in sector 7-G. Simpson, huh? A family man? Wife and three kids, sir. I'd like to see our self-styled Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers. What are we laughing at? One glazed and one Scratch-'N-Win, please. You look familiar, sir. Are you on the television or something? Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone. Oh. Liberty Bell. Another Liberty Bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty Bell, please, please, please. D'oh! That purple fruit thing. Where were you yesterday? Hey, hey. Looking good. What do you want, pal? Hey mister. Do, do, do, do, do Do dee do dee do Well, a "do dee do dee do" to you too, pint size. Jeez, you get a lot of nutcases in here. Oh, sir, I've seen things you can't imagine. Hey, hey, hey. I hear you, buddy. Whew. Full moon. Hmm. Still got it. What is the meaning of this? Meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir. Princess who? Hey, my photo. Your photo? Uh-oh. Why you little-- Why you big-- Bart, go to your room. I'm out of here. Look, Marge, honey, baby, doll, I-- Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now. What are you saying, honey? But where will I sleep? My suggestion... is for you to sleep in the filth you created. Would a motel be okay? Oh, I knew you'd come to your-- Here. If you have any soul left, you'll need these. I know I will. What's the matter, Homer? Hottest ladies' night in months... and you're not even checking out the action. Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave ho because of some lousy picture. What, this one? D'oh! So, uh, where are you staying tonight, Homer? Motel, I guess. Oh, no. No pal of mine is gonna stay... in some dingy flophouse. Ah. If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's an open beer in the fridge. Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on. Hey that's rough, pal. Hello, Marge. You left your damn porch light on. Barney! You left your damn porch light on. Barney! Homer's not made of money, you know. Who is this? Don't listen to him, Marge. He's-- Oh, it's you. Oh. Homer, you're overwrought. Why don't you unwind a bit? Party down the hall. You know, this apartment complex caters... to upscale young singles like me. No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed. Suit yourself, Homer. Nighty-night. I wonder when Dad's coming home. Homer Simpson. Homer Simpson. Report at once to Mr. Burns' office. Oh, no. What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson? What do you mean, sir? I mean this. A plant employee carrying on... like an oversexed orangutan in heat. This is a family nuclear powerplant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power... is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans. It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now? Just a second, Simpson. Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute? Yes, sir. Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitay life. The fair s*x remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain-- how shall I put it-- animal magnetism. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret. Uh, Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover boy. Simpson, I'm asking you nicely. I don't really know, sir. Simpson! Well, I wine them, I... dine them, bring them flowers, write them love poetry, sir. Of course. It's simplicity itself. I won't forget this, Simpson. Now return to your work and tell no one of what transpired here. Anybody home? Hi, Daddy. Welcome back, Dad. How's your mom? Still kind of ticked off. Yeah. Good luck, man. Oh, thanks, boy. Hello, Marge. It's me, Homer. Are you still mad? You are still mad. Don't need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk. Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge! Please forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Homer, you don't even know why you're apologizing. Yes, I do. Because I'm hungry, my clothes are smelly, and I'm tired. I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you. Oh, he does not. Yes, he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer. So what should I do, Marge? Well, I think you should take Bart... to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being... with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her. Okay. Your wish is my command, my little-- Do it! Princess Kashmir? You must mean April Flower. She's working over at the Girlesque. See, I'm tying to teach my son here about treating women as objects. Oh, that's a good idea. Uh, but April's over at Foxy Boxing tonight. Just let me say that it is an honor... to have Springfield's number-one swinger here with us to-- Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not? Uh, try Mud City. We're gonna try one more place, the Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor. ...he really loves me-- There she is. Hey, Princess, it's me, the guy from the snapshot. Oh. Oh, hi. Places, ladies, places. Can I get just a little cooperation? It's show time. I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object. Uh-huh. I also want my boy... to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter... and find out that she has thoughts and feelings too. Oh, well, okay. But can we make it quick? Nice to meet you, ma'am. Could you tell him a little about yourself? Well, uh, my real name is Shawna Tifton. Uh-huh. My pet peeve is rude people. Uh-huh. And my turn-ons include silk sheets... Uh-huh. and a warm fireplace. Thank you very much, ma'am. We'll be on our-- I've heard them say so often They can love their wives ooh But I think that's just foolish Men must have hearts Made of stone Now my heart is made Cool, man. Of softer stuff Get out of my cage. My boss will freak out. Oh, no. A pretty girl can't look my way without Don't. Don't! Don't. No. Get out. Get out of here. Get your hands off. A new romance Oh I could love a million girls And every girl a twin I could love a Chinese girl an Eskimo or-- Get off of my stage, fat boy. Hey, it's the guy from the picture. Homer Simpson! Sorry, partner. I didn't recognize you at first. Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor... to have a real swinging cat with us tonight. Homer Simpson, party guy. Mr. Maestro. Oh I could love a million girls And every girl a twin Yeah I could love a Chinese girl An Eskimo or Finn I could dig a Deutschland chick a girl with golden curls In fact I think that we could love About a million girls Heh. Hey. Ooh. Look out. Yeah. How does he do it, Smithers? He's a love machine, sir. Da, da, da Way to go, Dad. Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music. Quiet, please. I have something to say. Quiet. You with the hair, down in front. Oh, no. He's sunk even lower. I have something to say to all the sons out there. To all the boys, to all the men, to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews. Well, not our nephews. They are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as this sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife... on the back of my neck as I sleep... than to stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong? Or am I right? My wife gets the cutest little thing, right here, when she smiles. This is my Suzie. Oh, she's so cute. Here's mine. You know, my mom sounded a little down the other day. I'd better give her a call. Homer. Marge. All right, folks. Show's over. No more to see, folks. Come on. Only sick people want to see my folks kiss.
#01x11^Froggie, I'm home! Hi, little fella. I got some nice juicy flies for you. Geez, Louise. Look at this mess. I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun-- I like to play with you. My back. I like to play with you. There goes my back again. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. Go get help, boy. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you. Oh, Maggie. My poor back. I like to play with you. I like to p-- I like to play-- Dad! Homer, what happened? Oh, the boy. Bring me the boy. Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. So, you'll pick up this mess right now. Clumsy Homer. Everything's always my fault. If he'd just watch out where he was going. Hello. What have we here? Hello. What have we here? A cherry bomb. I thought I blew all you guys up. People, people, no rough-housing on the monkey bars. You there. Tuck in your shirt. Watch it. I saw that. You certainly have done awfully well for yourself, Spanky. Mother, please don't call me Spanky on school grounds. Wow! A cherry bomb! What are you going to do with it, Bart? Watch out, Bart. It's Skinner! Uh-oh. Good morning, Mr. Skinner. Morning, boys. Why haven't you introduced me to your students, Spanky? Well? Mother, I would like you to meet... Milhouse, Lewis, Richard and Bart Simpson. This is the Bart Simpson you're always talking about? Mm-hmm. But he looks so sweet. I am, Ma'am. Simpson! Let's move on now, Mother, shall we? I am, Ma'am. Simpson! Let's move on now, Mother, shall we? Bye, Spanky. What can I say? I've got a weakness for the classics. I think I need to make a stop at the little girls' room. Okay, Mother. This way. So long, sucker. Now hold it right there, you little-- Mother? Spanky? Oh, Marge, I still hurt. Marge. Marge! Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow? Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich. Well, okay. Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside. I know how you like 'em, Homer. And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can? Oh, and some fruit cocktail in heavy syrup. Marge. Marge. Marge, get the door! Principal Skinner! Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been... a very disturbing incident at school today. I'm outta here. Homer, Principal Skinner is here. Hello, Principal Skinner. I'd get up, but the boy crippled me. Mm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning... when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory. That ol' gag. Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatoy making use of the facilities. Oh, dear. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation. Deportation? You mean kick Bart out of the county? Hear him out, Marge. Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case, I'm prepared to make a big exception. And if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months... studying far, far away. Sounds great. Although, a kid can't learn much in just three months. Homer, you didn't even ask where Bart would be going. Actually, he'd be staying in France, in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine county. But Bart doesn't speak French. Oh, when he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks. Yeah, but what about Bart? I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And, uh, the whole thing won't cost you a dime, as long as you're willing to take in a student of your own. Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal in France... isn't pulling the same scam you are? For one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You'd be getting an Albanian. You mean all white with pink eyes? No. No, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a county on the Adriatic Sea. Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this. The life of a frog. That's the life for me. Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France? France? Wow! He makes me crazy 12 months a year. At least you get the summer off. Mm-hmm. And I get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom? Yes, Bart. Wow! And one back? Mm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea. Yes, baby! Way to go! Bon voyage, boy. Good-bye, my special-- my special little guy. You will write us, won't you? All the time. What do you know about France? I know I'm going, and you're not. I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen, while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your county. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room. Okay, Dad. Is one of you going to be on the charter flight? Yes, sir. Mm-hmm. Come along. Bye. Be good. We'll miss you. Hey, man, watch it. Ooh! Oh! Ow! Oh! Hey, man. It's me, Bart Simpson. Okay, kid. Let's go. Hey! Every little breeze seems to whisper Louise Birds in the trees seem to Louise La la la laa La la la la la Ooh la la! How much longer, sir? This is where we're going, right? Chateau Mah-son. Eww. What a dump. You know, in Albania, the unit of currency is called The lek. You gotta be kiddin'. The lek. And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field. Give me the old stars and stripes. And the main export is furious political thought. Political what? Trans Albanian Airlines, flight number two, Tirana to Springfield, is now arriving. Welcome to your new home. Escape is impossible. My name is Cesar. This is my nephew, Ugolin. You may find life here at the chateau hard, but if you shut up and do exactly what we say, the time will pass more quickly. He's right, you know. Well, okay, sir. Adil? Mother? Well, I guess for the next few months, yes, I will be your mother. And this must be Lisa and Maggie. And you must be my new father, Homer. Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he? Hey, come on, guys. Quit being so grabby. Sorry, man. Be my guest. You may find his accent peculiar. Certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I urge you all to give little Adil the benefit of the doubt. In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world. Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank you, fellow students. Although I have only been in your county a few days, I have already found Americans to be most... trusting. Although, officially, I am required to hate you, I want you to know I do not feel it in my heart. Hurry up, boy. My grapes are waiting for their water. How can you defend a country... where 5% of the people control 95% of the wealth? I'm defending a county where people can think, act and worship anyway they want. Can not. Can not. Can too. Can too. Please, please, kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism... being oiled with the blood of the workers. Your father is right. We should not fight. Friends? Well, okay. Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes. No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been oppressed enough for today. I will clear the dishes. Oh. Okay. Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing. Homer! Your paper-thin commitment to your children... sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused? Lisa! Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it. And if she doesn't, we can always exchange her. Homer! just kidding. Can I have something to go with my turnip? Quiet! When you work like a man, we will feed you like one. Now go to sleep! Hey, hey, come on. Move it, pal. You leave Maurice alone. The floor is good enough for you. You go to sleep there. Nice and cozy, Adil? Yes. Thank you, Father. Look, Adil, you can call me Dad. All right, Dad. Aw! You called me Dad. Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant? You wanna see where I work? Oh, yes, very much. None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work. Then I can go? Well, I'll have to pull a few strings... with the boys in security, but sure, you bet. Excellent. Now watch me. You grab the grape between your thumb and forefinger... and gently twist it off and drop it in the bucket. Now you do it. Very good. Now do it a million times. See these? American doughnuts. Glazed, powdered and raspberry-filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice? Dad, do you think I might see your plutonium isolation module? Uh... maybe. Hold on a second. Hey, Lenny. Hmm? Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals? Yeah, over in sector 12. Sector 12? Third floor, by the candy machines. Oh, that sector 12. Come along, Adil. Ungrateful swine! We give you food, we give you shelter, and this is how you repay us! You little shutterbug. Cheese! Cheese! Oh, wait a minute. Stupid grapes. Bunch of creeps! I hate France! You sure have taken a shine to little Adil. Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that. Well, okay, I will, if you admit you love Bart. Okay. Okay. I love Bart. Well? What? Well? Oh, Adil's a very sweet boy. Darn tootin'. "Dear Bart, How is France?" I don't know why you haven't written. "I guess you're just having too much fun." Oh, yeah, right. Silence! "Everyone here in the United States is fine." We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in math, which I'm only mentioning as news. I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night, he went to sleep... "talking about how much he loves you." Oh. "Remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can..." to your adopted parents. "All my love. Mom." Oh. What are you doing? Get out of here! Sorry. On second thought, Bart. Bart, come here. Drink this. No, thanks. Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then. Yeah, but it's got antifreeze in there. Drink it! Oh! Ooh! Oh, Bart. Oh. You're a policeman, aren't you? Excusez-moi. Je ne parle pas Anglais. But you gotta help me. These two guys I'm staying with, they work me day and night. They don't feed me. They make me sleep on the-- I-- I don't want a piece of candy. I need your-- Come on, Mister. Can you help me? Oh, forget it. I'm so stupid. Anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. Here I've listened to nothing but French for the past... Honey, I'm home. Hello, Homer. What's that? Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to. All right, Sparrow. We know you're in there. We'll give you one minute to surrender. Oh, my! Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out. I'm his neighbor. What did he do? Well, sir, we-- Well, sir, we've been on the trail... of a spy transmitting highly confidential information... to an unfriendly nation. Ooh! Mm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point. Wow. That's all I can tell you. Aw. All right. Well, the name of his county starts with the letter "A." Hmm. Ooh! Time's up, Sparrow. We're coming in after you. Oh, gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this. Adil? The Sparrow! Adil. Oh, there you are. Get him! Au revoir, suckers. So, he's going to prison? No. We've arranged an exchange for one of our own men caught in Albania. So, Sparrow, we meet again. Yes. Sometimes I think I am getting too old for this game. Okay, kids. Let's hurry it up. Good-bye, Simpsons. Thank you for your hospitality. I hope this experience will not sour you on the student exchange program. Good-bye, Adil. Have a nice trip. Good-bye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted. Air France, flight dix-neufcentquatre-vingtshuit, Paris to Springfield, is now arriving. Look, Mom. There he is! Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home. Hey, where's the big guy? He means me. Hey, boy. Hey, Homer. He brought us gifts. His first unselfish act. So, basically, I met one nice French person. Bart, I have something to say that's gonna bother me if I don't say it. It's good to see you. Same here. I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us. Sorry, Marge. Some wise guy stuck a cork in the bottle. You hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French. Shh!
#01x12^Hey, kids! Who do you love? Krusty! How much do you love me? With all our hearts! What would you do if I went off the air? We'd kill ourselves! What's that, Sideshow Bob? This is Brittany and today's her birthday? Well, happy birthday, Brittany! How do you want to celebrate? Do you want me to sing you a birthday song? Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon? The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. Sorry, Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish! You're doomed, Sideshow Bob. I know we haven't had much luck shooting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough... gunpowder! Brittany, do the honors. Don't blame me. I didn't do it. Comedy, thy name is Krusty. Hey, kids, it's time for ltchy and Scratchy! They fight, they bite. They bite and fight and bite. Fight, fight, fight Bite, bite, bite. The Itchy and Scratchy Show Oh, my! All this senseless violence. I don't understand its appeal. We don't expect you to, Mom. If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time. Y'ello. Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could pick up... a half-gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work. Ooh, premium-- Wait a minute. Why? Patty and Selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the Yucatan. Doh! Anybody home? Ooh, I've got to go, Homer. My sisters are here. Oh, eight carousels! We're in for a real treat. Hello, steady customer. How are you this evening, sir? How ya doin', Apu? Hello, steady customer. How are you this evening, sir? How ya doin', Apu? New flavor-- triple chocolate! Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register. What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream. The reason I look unhappy is that tonight... I have to see a slideshow starring my wife's sisters. Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome. Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy-- Sorry, pal. Hand over all your money in a paper bag. Yes, yes. I know the procedure for armed robbery. I do work in a convenience store, you know. You can emerge now from my chips. The opportunity to prove yourself a hero is long gone. This is our tour group. Mm-hmm. This is a Mexican delicacy called a taco platter. Mmm, delicious. This is Selma taking a siesta. "Ay, carumba!" And he had a big nose. No, bigger. And big red hair that came out to-- Yeah, yeah, like that! Well, it is a simple, charcoal rendering, but, uh, is this the man? Yeah! wait a minute. It's the guy from TV! My kid's hero, Cruddy, Crummy-- Krusty the Clown! Ahh. Hey, hey, what's goin' on here? Krusty the Clown, you're under arrest for armed robbery. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say-- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. What is this, a joke? Ready, Mr. Simpson? Yes, sir. Send in the clowns. So, Simpson, which one is it? Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty! No, no! Which one is the robber? Oh, definitely number... Simpson. Simpson! four. And this is all the mail that awaited us upon our return. And this is Selma... dropping of four vacation film to be developed. Thus concludes our Mexican odyssey. Hmm. Very thorough. I'm home, everybody! Oh, goody gumdrops. You missed the whole slide show, Homer. Oh, fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when-- Ooh, ooh, ooh, the news! Springfield's number one news team... with our Emmy Award-winning anchorman Kent Brockman, Good evening, I'm Scott Christian. Kent Brockman is off tonight. Why did the clown cross the road? To rob a Kwik-E-Mart. The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message. Wait a minute. Bart, you know that guy on your lunch box? Oh, you mean, Krusty the Clown? He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he? Are you kidding? He's my idol. I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings. Uh, maybe you'd better run off to bed. Krusty the Clown is behind bars... after a daring twilight robbery of a local Kwik-E-Mart. Krusty! Oh, no! Earlier this evening, the Springfield SWAT team... apprehended the TV clown, who appears on a rival station... opposite our own Emmy Award-winning Hobo Hank. And just in, actual footage of the crime... taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera. The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see... a slide show starring my wife's sisters. Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome. Oh, Homer. So, the truth comes out. Hand over all your money in a paper bag. Oh, Krusty, how could you? I know it looks very bad, honey. Who knows, maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along. Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there. The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y. You're my best friend. Thanks, Krusty. Buy my cereal. Buy my cereal. I didn't do it! Oh, I wish I could believe you. Good evening, again, Springfield. Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of countless tots, now nothing more than a common, alleged criminal. His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media circus... as children of all ages from eight to 80... hang on each new development like so many Romanian trapeze artists. From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi, Krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire... with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers-- Krusty's near-fatal, on-the-air heart attack in 1986. Wasn't that a great ltchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up. But first, I've got a hankerin'... for some pork products. Mmm. Look. Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling-- I'm dying. I'm dying. But a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back. However, he was a changed clown. Where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike... as simpleminded TV mayhem, this new Krusty devoted a small portion of every show... to stamping out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a-thrill youth. Give a hoot. Read a book. Krusty's arrest has sent shockwaves through Springfield, packing its churches, synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizeny from all walks of life. I urge every halfway decent member of our community... to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of Krusty, that clown prince of corruption, and join me in a public burning! So, is Krusty the Clown about to trade in his baggy pants... for the relatively snug uniform of Springfield Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow when his trial begins. Uh, what kind of gun did you use? Did you use an accomplice? Will you plead insanity? Look at him. His clothes are so drab. His face is so flesh-colored and sad. And his feet, they're so small. Say it ain't so, Krusty. My client has no comment at this time. I didn't do it. Krusty the Clown, how do you plead? I plead guilty, Your Honor. Oh. I mean, not guilty. Opening night jitters, Your Honor. I would like to call to the stand, Homer J.Simpson. Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it. Sorry, son. You'll understand one day. He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Oh, come on, Dad. You got to listen to me. Sorry, pal. Doh! Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive... into that display of heavily-salted snack treats? Yes, sir. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today? Yes, I do. Fine. Would you point him out to us? Okay. Aaah! Oh, man. Let the record show that the witness... eventually... pointed to... Krusty the Clown. These toys are just adorable. Who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius? But, Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality. No, I'm not! I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now, come on, son. Get with the winning team. Hey, right here! Krusty souvenirs! Buy 'em and burn 'em! Good people, I'm so happy you're all here tonight. But please, just a few words of caution. Now, we are going to set this pile of evil ablaze, but because these are children's toys, the fire will spread quickly. So, please stand back, and try not to inhale the toxic fumes. Ooh! Krusty, would you please turn your attention to Exhibit B. Uh-- Tell me what you see. Uh, uh-- Which one do you mean? The one with the big "B" on it. Uh, uh, uh-- What's the matter? Can't you read? No, I can't! I can't read or write! I admit it! I'm totally illiterate. Now are you happy? Can it be that the champion of child literacy can't even read himself? Is it a crime to be illiterate? All right, all right. See this, Krusty? This is a B. And this is Exhibit B. Betting slips-- obtained by this court indicating you have lost... substantial sums of money on sports gambling. Is it a crime to bet on sporting events? Yes, it is! Oh. Foreperson, have you reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor. We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown... guilty. I knew it! This happens to me every time. My young friends, for years I have been silent... save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument. But now, destiny has thrust me into the center ring. In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program. Please do not be alarmed. Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here. But we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette... and all the lively arts. What the hell are you doing, Lis? I'm watching Sideshow Bob. He's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be. You backstabber, you traitor, you-- Snap out of it, Bart! Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook. Look, Lisa. I know Krusty's innocent. Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling I have. Oh, Bart. Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help. You do? Why? Oh, come on, Lis. You know why. No, why? I'll never forgive you for making me say this. You're smarter than me. So, you with me? Yeah, man. Oh, oh. Okay, okay. Don't try anything funny. I'm armed to the teeth. Bart, look, over here on the microwave. So, I don't have a pacemaker. Come on, Bart. The tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito. So? Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack... when he had a pacemaker put in. Aha! Wait a minute. Krusty can't read. Okay! Okay! So the poor guy can't read. Can't we get off his back, already? No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read? Hey, hey. This is not a lending library! If you're not going to buy that thing put it down, or I'll blow your heads off! Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed! Did he have any enemies? I don't know. But I know someone who would-- Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob! "A volley of muskety flamed, thundered, roared." A profound silence followed, broken only by the approaching footsteps... "- of the Third Brigade." Next week, chapter 35 of The Man in the lron Mask: "The Death of a Titan." Well, kids, that's our show for today. And now, in the words of Mr. Cole Porter. Evey time we say good-bye I die a little Evey time we say good-bye I wonder why a little Evey time we say Good-bye Good-bye. Great show, Sideshow. Switchboards were jammed. The kids loved it. Thanks, Ed. I glad we've finally dispelled the myth... that I'm too uptown for the tots. And yet, I can't help thinking about poor Krusty. We see your face on key chains. And water-action pens. And snow domes. This is all very exciting, but I think we'd do well to explore the more upscale market. For instance, Sideshow Bob limited-edition prints, collector's plates, commemorative coins. Ah. Some kids are here to see you, Sideshow Bob. They say it's important. Ah, well, we can sign these contracts tomorrow. Certainly. I take great pride in being able to sign my own name. That's a good one. I gotta tell the wife. Hi, Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few-- Forgive me. As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting. Here you go-- three tickets. Be my guests. Uh, okay. But-- Come, come. Let's run along. Hello, children. Whom do you love? Sideshow Bob! Come on, Bart. Go with the flow. How much do you love me? With all our hearts! About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty. Today's show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit. But first, I regret to say I see a youngster who looks troubled. What's your name, young man? Bart Simpson, sir. Hmm. Well, perhaps we can shed some light... on your problem in a new segment exploring preadolescent turmoil. I call it "Choices." I don't think so, sir. Bart, I'm reaching out to you. So, what's on your mind, Bart? I bet the other children don't accept you. True, Sideshow Bob. But that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I... have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed. Framed? Well, the videotape showed... that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing, not with his pacemaker. Well, you know, Bart. As much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctor's orders too seriously. Well, maybe, but get this. Krusty was illiterate, and the guy who robbed the store... was reading the Springfield Review of Books. Ah, well, Bart. The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag. Yeah, I guess those are kind of funny. Bart, children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us. But we must get on with our lives. Let's try to remember Krusty, not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car. And shot you out of a cannon. And shot me out of a cannon. Yes, we will never forget that, will we? Bart, open you heart. I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill-- In ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicism. Wait a minute! You did it! Excuse me? Attention, fellow children! Krusty didn't rob that store! Sideshow Bob framed him, and I got proof! Ow! My foot! You lousy, stupid, clumsy-- See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes, but he's got little feet like all good-hearted people! Sideshow Bob really fills his shoes with big ugly feet. Kid's right. How do you figure we missed that? Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio! Yes, I admit it. I hated him! His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty! And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids. Take him away, boys. Treat kids as equals! They're people too! They're smarter than you think. They were smart enough to catch me! Well, we... made... a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh, it won't happen again. It better not, you dimwit! Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard... about what goes on in prison are exaggerated. Well, the important thing is that I regain the trust of the children. But there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart? Yes, sir? Thank you. Shh.
#01x13^Now to our own pie in the sky-- Bill Pie in the KBBL trafficcopter. So come in, Bill. Bad news, drivers. There's an overturned melon truck on the interstate. Oh, it's a mess.

Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those wackos. Tell me 'bout your husband, Marge. Well-- When we were dating, he was sweeter... and more romantic and 40 pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils. What was that last thing you said? Ah. Isn't that your wife, Homer? Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on. Marge, it's what I call "harsh reality time." Your husband sees you as nothing. Oh. Okay. Well, thank you. No, no, no, don't hang up.

Hey, Barney, am I a pig? You're no more of a pig than I am. Oh, no! See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Lary's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, table cloth, the whole nine yards. Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that. I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town... and not check out until the next morning, if you get my drift. I read you loud and clear. Heh, heh, heh, heh! Wow, a quarter past 6:00. What's keeping Dad? Yeah, who'd possibly be late on meatloaf night? Uh, I'd like some flowers. What kind of flowers? You know, pretty ones, not dead. We have some beautiful long-stem roses. They're $55 a dozen. One, please. Hey, Mom. How 'bout some grub? Aaah! Your husband sees you as nothing, as nothing.

Hold on. I'll check. Oliver Klozoff! Call for Oliver Klozoff! And I made reservations at the Chez Paree. But, Homer, it's so expensive. It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Offramp lnn. Oh, Homer! I feel giddy! Wait. What about a baby-sitter? Oops. Not to worry. Listen, ya lousy bum. If I ever get a hold of you, I'll cut your belly open. Goodness. Must be a crossed wire. Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Baby-sitting Service. This is Marge Simpson. I'd like a baby-sitter for the evening. Wait a minute. The Simpsons. Lady, you've gotta be kidding! Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Baby-sitting Service. Hello. This is Mr. S-Sampson. Did your wife just call a second ago? No, I said Sampson, not Simpson. Thank God! Those Simpsons, what a bunch of savages! Especially that big-ape father. Doh! Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family. Mom, you look so glamorous. Well, tonight is a very special night. Your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing. Dad dances? Like an angel. Ba, ba Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba-ba Work that body, Homer. You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man. Not if I can help it. Son, there's not a woman alive... who can resist a man who knows how to mambo. You don't have a clue, do you, Dad? Out, boy. Out! What a grump. Hm. Hm. Hmm! Hm, hm. Hmm? Hee. Smooth as a baby's behind! Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba Precious, I think I hear the doorbell. I think you're right, dumplin'. Bart! Get the door! Aye, aye, mambo man. Oof! Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba You must be the baby-sitter. Yes. I am Miss Botz. just don't stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases. I can handle my own luggage. Thank you for coming on such short notice. Here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining... and the motel where we'll be spending the night. You'll have to put Maggie to bed now, but Bart and Lisa can stay up for another hour. Until then, they can watch a tape from our video library. Oh, boy! The Happy Little Elves Meet the Curious Bear Cub. Oh, the Elves! The Elves! Bye, kids! Watch out for the boy. Mmmwha! Bye, now. Mmmwha! Be good. Mmmwha! Gotta go. Ba, ba Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba Come, children. Let's go watch The Happy Little Elves. We've seen the Crappy Little Elves about 14 billion times. Maybe we can watch some real TV. We're gonna watch the tape. Aw! That's merely suggested viewing matter, lady. Mom lets us watch what ever we want. I said you're gonna watch this tape. And you're gonna do what I say, or I'm gonna do something to you. And I don't know what that is, because everybody has always done what I say. They all look so tasty, but I think I'll eat this one right there. Why don't you pick one that's a little more frisky, sir. Why? Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster. Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes. Excellent choice, sir. May I lead you to your table? Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later. Help! Help! Faster, faster! We gotta save Bubbles. Oh, man, I can't take it anymore. But I want to see what happens! You know what happens. They find Captain Kook's treasure. All the elves dance around like idiots. I puke. The end. Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love. Now for some real TV. All right! America's Most Armed and Dangerous. Oh, no! Bart! We'll have nightmares! Relax. This is cinema verite. When the brutal, slow-motion killing starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes. The Cue Ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous. If you think you've seen him, call I -800-U-SQUEAL. Homer, you look just like a little boy. 'Cause I'm so care free? No, because you're wearing a bib. More champagne? Mmm. Whoops. Time for a fill-up. Garcon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne. The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living room... while the bandit roamed through the house at will, stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for. You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating. Except for one thing-- no chaperone. Ho, ho, hoo! The Baby-sitter Bandit has left a trail of her daring nighttime robberies... across the continental United States. She could be lurking anywhere, about to descend upon another house full of unsuspecting dupes. Eee! Wow! In a moment, we will show you a picture of the real Baby-sitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski. Remember, she may be using a clever alias... Botz! And should be considered armed and dangerous! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Run for it! 1 -800-U-SNITCH.No, U-SQUEAL. Oh, no! Don't forget to tell me when you see the Offramp. Oh, thereit-- went. No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit. Bart. Bart. Bart. Bart. Hmm. Time to brush your teeth, wash your face... and say your prayers. Are you in... here? Oh! Homemade pickled beets. Go ahead. Take 'em all. Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this. Come on! Come on! Finally! Hello, vigilant viewer. You have reached America's Most Armed and Dangerous. I'm calling to report the Baby-sitter Bandit! She's in our house right-- Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold. Okay, but watch out. Don't slam my head like last time. Sheesh! Eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it! Don't muss my hair! Ohh! Oh! Oh! Yi! Oh! Yeow! Yi! Oh! Yeow! Whee! This is fun! We know who you are, Miss Botz. Or should I say Miss Botzcowski? You're the Baby-sitter Bandit. You're a smart, young man, Bart. I hope you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut. He isn't. You're crazy if you think you're gonna get away with this. You can't-- I'm really not a bad person. Here. While I finish up, you guys can watch the rest of your favorite videocassette. Quiet, Bart! Let's make the best of this. Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable. Oh! Your blue thing with the things? You'll see. Well, shake a leg, mama. Kidstuff! Hardly worth it. Lotta junk. Soileds. Stupid Sampsons. Maggie! Maggie! Come here! Good-bye! Good-bye, everybody! Bye! Yea! Maggie, wanna watch The Happy Little Elves again? Okay, but you have to untie me first. Oh, Homer! Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh, so you got out of your crib. I guess you need to be tied up too. Maggie, where are you? Maggie! Maggie! Heh, heh, heh. Homer, would it spoil the mood if I called home, you know, just to check on the kids? Homer, wake up! There's no answer at home. So? So I'm worried. I think we should go home. All right. I suppose my work here is done. Heh, heh, heh, heh! Hello, vigilant viewer. How may we help you? We caught her! We caught the Baby-sitter Bandit! She's tied up at our house. Ask if there's a reward. Is there a reward? If she's convicted, we get T-shirts! Yeah! How come all the lights are on? I don't like the looks of this. Miss Botz! Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now? We're so sorry. We're so sorry! Please turn off the TV. I can't tell you how chagrined we are about all of this. Oh, these things are heavy. Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple. Thank you. Mr. Sampson, can I give you a bit of advice? Sure. Don't turn your back on that boy for a second. Ain't that the truth? You know, one time he-- Huh? This way to the scene of the crime, men! I got her tied up in the den. Just a minute, young man! I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your baby-sitter and pay her off so that-- Excuse me. Are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted... the escape of the notorious Baby-sitter Bandit? The what? The Baby-sitter Bandit. Oh, uh, a-are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because actually it was quite a struggle. Oh, Homer! Have you ever seen a kung fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you'd better think long and hard before tying something like this on Homer Simpson again! Lord, help me. I'm just not that bright. Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children... who can knock out and hogtie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right. Yeah. Yeah! Mmmmwha! Honey, can we make up again? Oh, my goodness! Shh!
#02x01^Bart, no more interruptions during Martin's book report. Never have I seen a more noble thing than you, brother. I do not care who kills who. To catch a fish, to kill a bull, to make love to a woman. To live. I thank you. Oh, absolutely brilliant! I truly believed you were Hemingway. Bravo, Martin. Call me Papa. Some ketchup for your buns, Papa? We have time for one more report. Bart Simpson? Is your book report ready? Is it ready? What a question! Students, prepare to be dazzled. The name of the book that I read was Treasure lsland. It's about these pirates... with patches over their eyes and shiny gold teeth. And green birds on their shoulders. Did I mention it was written by Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by McGraw-Hill. So in conclusion, on a scale of I to 10... 10 being the highest, I the lowest, and 5 average, I give it... a 9. Questions? No? Then I'll sit down. Did you read the book? I'm insulted. Is this a book report or a witch hunt? Then perhaps you'll tell us the name of the pirate. Blackbeard, Captain Nemo, Captain Hook, Bluebeard. Bluebeard? Sit down. I'll see you after class. Your grades have gotten worse. Did you know that? Yes, ma'am. Did you know there's a test tomorrow? Yes, ma'am. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Yes, ma'am. Blah, blah, blah. Yes, ma'am. You haven't been paying attention! Yes, ma'am. Then what did I say? Straighten up and fly right? Lucky guess. Take that, granny! Hide! Deadly mothballs. Granny's kissing me! You reached the level of ungrateful grandchild. Try again, if you dare! A couple more games and I'll hit the books. Soup's on! Hurry up, or it'll get that skin. I hate that icky soup skin. After dinner, it's down to business. Marge, get me another beer. Wait, Lisa has some news. He doesn't care, Mom. I do. I want a beer while I'm caring. Homer! Go ahead, Lisa. I got an A on my vocabulary test. You did! Well, that's just.... Oh, what a glorious day! Hand me your paper. I'll put it on the refrigerator. I might as well kill two birds with one stone. You covered up my paper! Look at those funny little whiskers. That reminds me. It's Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. No, Dad, I should really-- Gorilla the Conqueror. The granddaddy of them all. Well, maybe just one more hour. It's so unfair. Just because he's different. Time to hit the books. Burning the candle at both ends, boy? All right, let's take care of some business. "Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom." On September 15, 1620, separatists from the Church of England... some living in Holland, left Plymouth, England. "Their destination was...." Marge, come take a look at this. The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing? Just a little dim, I guess. Bart, you're gonna miss your bus. Hey, Bart-dude. You look freaked. I got a test I'm not ready for. Can you crash the bus? Sorry, I can't do it on purpose. But maybe you'll get lucky. Okay, don't panic. Find an egghead and pump him for some answers. I bet he didn't study again. Now he'll try to get answers from us. He's pathetic. Morning, girls. Good morning, Bart. Who's up for a cram session? I'll go first. Name the pilgrim's boat. The Spirit of St. Louis. Where'd they land? Sunny Acapulco. Why'd they leave England? Giant rats. Cool, history's coming alive. I don't know why I should care... but the information that you just received is erroneous. You're saying-- A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in his teeth has more chances than you. Thanks for the pep talk. All right, take one and pass the rest back. Think, Simpson! Crisis brings out the best in you. What is it, Bart? Nothing. Must. Take. Test. What's the matter, son? Stabbing pains in my stomach. Oh, dear, I've heard of this. Do you feel pain in your arm? Both arms. Temporary loss of vision? Who said that? Come closer. Yes, dear? Maybe one more dish. Make it cappuccino chocolate fudge. Your third bowl. I think you're on the mend. Anything else I can get you? Perhaps the TV? Of course. Homer! What? Bring the TV up. Bart's got his vision back! I wish I had amoria phlebitis. I know you're faking it. Keep your mouth shut. You'll still fail that test. I've got my bases covered. Milhouse, what'd I miss today? Richard laughed milk through his nose. What about that history test? Piece of cake? What'd you get for number one? Number two? Yeah, that sounds right. Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. You'll be pleasantly surprised. This test is worse than Milhouse's! Bart, I warned you. This is the final straw! You know our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor. Hey, Dr. J. This is a classic case of what laymen refer to as "fear of failure." Bart is an underachiever, yet he seems to be.... How should I put this? Proud of it. One of his problems is a short attention span. Blah, blah, blah. Bart failed his last four exams. Is there anything you haven't told us? Everyone else in the class has shown some improvement. Yet you continue to struggle. Why? I don't know. Look at these results: 55, 42, 26. A 12 on state capitals! Why are we dancing around the obvious? We all know it. I'm dumb as a post. Think I'm happy? You're just a late bloomer. It isn't that simple. As emotionally crippling as it may be, my recommendation is for Bart to... repeat the fourth grade. You can't! I'll do better! That'll be the day. Maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad. You can't hold me back. I swear I'll do better. Look in my eyes. See the sincerity? See the fear? As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade! If not, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids. Get off the bus and forever hold your peace, little dudes. Otto, I respect you. You let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus. Damn thing never goes over, does it? So what's in your head? I've been failing a lot of tests recently. They'll hold me back if I don't shape up. That's it? Relax, man. It could be the best thing to happen to you. I got held back in the fourth grade. Twice. And look at me, man. Now I drive the school bus! My recommendation is for Bart to repeat the fourth grade. All right, class, the topic is world literature. What was the pirate's name in Treasure lsland, Bart Simpson? I got a peptic ulcer, my wife wants a new car and I need a root canal. Quit bugging me about the pirate. Long John Silver, Dad. I heard that, Bart Jr. I want to see both of you after class. Thanks a lot, son. Yo, little help! I said little help. Throw me the ball, Poindexter. I'm sorry, Bart. I don't know the rules of your sport. I didn't want to interfere with a ball in play. Back to the forecastle of the Pequod. Hey, Martin. I have nothing of value. Help me get a passing grade. You need someone's help, but I don't know why that someone should be me. I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you. They laugh at me? I'd always considered myself rather popular. You're not. Watch. My speed with numbers, my years as a hall monitor... my prize-winning dioramas, they mean nothing to them? Perhaps another demonstration. Very well, you've made your point. Then it's a deal? Yes. Let's have a look at your study area. Study area? Your sanctuary from the frenzy of modern life. There's a desk under that junk. No, this won't do at all. We have to clean up this room. And we'll need a fern. No room is complete without plant life. No. Geeks sit in the front. From now on, you sit in the back row. That goes for school and church too. Why? So no one can see what you're doing. I understand. Mischief varies inversely with proximity to the authority figure. Yeah, but don't say it like that. Soon you'll be ready to try it with a real book. Pushing a boy into the girls' lavatory was such a thrill! The screams, the humiliation, the fact that it wasn't me! I've never felt so alive. Now, the test is tomorrow-- Who cares about some test? Life's too short! I thought we had a deal. The old Martin no longer exists. Come on, fellows, to the arcade! Cool, Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin! Bart, it's past your bedtime. Okay. This is hopeless. This is the end of the road. I haven't always been a good kid. But if I go to school tomorrow, I'll fail and be held back. I need one more day to study, Lord. I need your help. Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel. A teacher strike, a power failure. Anything that'll cancel school. I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. Thanking you in advance, your pal, Bart Simpson. Wake up, Bart. Rise and shine, little guy. Oh, no. Wake up and look at the snow. Whoa! Good morning, world! It's the Bill and Marty Show. He's Bill. He's Marty. We can't get enough of each other. We've got snow-formation for you flake lovers. The gas and water plants are closed. And the nuclear power plant. That's closed too. All right! Now, for all you youngsters, here it is. Springfield county schools are-- Oh, I'm too excited! Springfield schools will be closed! All right! Come back, you're supposed to eat breakfast! Cowabunga! Remember to take a break if your arms go numb! Last night, you prayed for this. Now your prayers have been answered. I don't know who or what God is exactly. But he's more powerful than Mom and Dad put together. And you owe him big. You're right. I asked for a miracle, and I got it. I gotta study. I'm not missing anything. Frozen ears. Trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over. How good could it be? I haven't had this much fun in years. Gotcha, Burnsie. I was never one to back away from a snowball fight. Smithers, fire at will. Certainly. I hereby declare this day to be Snow Day... the funnest day in the history of Springfield! Gotta study, gotta study! "Four Days in Philadelphia." The first Congress faced a difficult job. "Could they make decisions that Americans could support?" We hold these truths to be self-evident. We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That from that equal creation, they derive rights-- Look, everybody! It's snowing! In the middle of July? It's a miracle. I've invented something fun. The sled. Look, John Hancock's writing his name in the snow! Do you want to be held back a grade? Concentrate, man! Later, Mrs. K. Please turn in your exam, Bart. Class is over. Could you grade it now? Well, all right. Let me get Old Red. It's a 59. That's another F. Oh, no, I can't believe it. I know. Another year together. It's gonna be hell. What's the matter? I thought you'd be used to failing. No, you don't understand. I tried this time. I really tried. There, there. This is as good as I can do, and I still failed. Well, a 59. It's a high F. Who am I kidding? I really am a failure. Now I know how Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity in 1754. You know, 1754. The famous defeat to the French. My God, Bart, you're right! So? You demonstrated applied knowledge. Such an obscure reference deserves an extra point. It's only fair. You mean I passed? Just barely. I passed. I got a D minus! I passed! All right! I passed! I passed! I passed! I got a D minus! I got a D minus! I passed! I got a D minus! I passed! l-- Kissed the teacher?! We're proud of you. Thanks, Dad, but part of this D minus belongs to God.
#02x02^The capital of North Dakota is named after what German ruler? Hitler! North Dakota? Bismarck. Hitler? I'm still beating you, boy. The colors of the ltalian flag are red, white and what? Blue. Red. Green. Black, green. Green. I was right! We'll be right back with more Grade School Challenge. I used to think hair loss was inevitable. I found Dimoxinil, the breakthrough in hair regrowth. Breakthrough? There's been a breakthrough?! Dimoxinil can help me grow as much or as little hair as I want to. Hey, today I'm gonna do it. For your free brochure, send $5 to Dimoxinil. Hair. Hair. Just like everybody else. Some women find bald men quite virile. Weren't you listening? This is a breakthrough. Not one of these cheap-o sucker deals. Allow me to present the Dimoxinil action set. A six-month supply of the drug, gravity boots, scalp massager and a T-shirt. Great. How much? $1000. A thousand bucks? I can't afford that! We do have a product which is more in your price range. However, any hair growth while using it will be coincidental. A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off screw job, cheap joint.... Forget you, pal. Thanks for nothing. So I say, "Forget you, pal. Thanks for nothing." I storm right out. That's telling them. Out of tartar sauce. They call this a portion? Are you gonna use your sauce? Dry fish sticks! This sucks. Stop whining, chrome dome. lf I had hair, you wouldn't say that. Homer, don't be a sap. Fill out some insurance forms. Charge Dimoxinil to the company. It's $1000. Burns would can my butt. Oh, $1000. So what? So he has one less ivory back scratcher. You pay into the insurance fund. What do you get? Nothing. The newsletter. Why get nothing while a guy who loses a finger hits the jackpot? You got me. I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance. I don't know who put you up to this... but no insurance plan covers something as frivolous as Dimoxinil! Meet me in the alley in 15 minutes. Come alone. Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen. I have hair. I have hair! I have hair! Look, look! Morning, Springfield. Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield. Get a haircut, you hippie! Good morning, Moe's Tavern! It's the president. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Good morning, everybody! Good morning, Springfield! Dimoxinil! Homer Simpson! You haven't been here in 20 years. You got rid of the sideburns. Give me the usual. He's much happier at work. Just between us girls, he hasn't been this frisky in years. I don't want to think about it. Daddy's home, sugar. Come here, you. Homie, my sisters are here. Dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven. This is Homer? Patty, stop drooling. Look who's talking. You look different, Homer. Lose weight? You got a tan. I know what it is, a new tie. Pathetic morons in my employ, stealing my precious money. None of these cretins deserves a promotion. It's in the union contract. One token promotion per year. Wait. Who is that young go-getter? Looks like Homer Simpson, only more dynamic and resourceful. Simpson? An unspoiled lump of clay to mold in my own image. Our new junior executive! Bring him to me. Homer Simpson, you've been promoted. You're now an executive. Take three minutes to say goodbye... and report to room 503 for reassignment to a better life. Your "resume" seems in order. Do you have any specialties? Backrubs for harried executives. I'll show you. No, that will be fine. Thank you, goodbye. Hello. How's my big, important executive? Oh, Marge. Every woman I interview makes kissy faces at me. Hello, Mr. Simpson. I'm Karl. Hire him. I'll call you back. Meeting in the board room tomorrow at 2. Sit there and keep your mouth shut. Yes. He thinks he's so big. You don't belong here. You don't belong here. You're a fraud and a phony, and they'll find you out. Who told you? You did. With the way you talk into your chest... the way you smother yourself in lime-green polyester. I want you to say to yourself, "I deserve this. I love it. I am nature's greatest miracle." Go ahead, say it. Trust me, Homer. Say it! I deserve it. Louder. I deserve it! Shout it. I am nature's greatest miracle! Three weeks' vacation plus expenses. You got it! Let's go shopping. Beauty. A man's suit should make him a prince. It should cry out: "Here I am. Don't judge me, love me." Do any of these suits do that? No. I like this. No, no. Stand naturally, Mr. Simpson. Let it all hang out. You, conceal it. Mom and Dad have been kissing. Gotta run. Happy anniversary, Homer. Our anniversary, are you sure? Don't worry, this year you have an excuse. With your job and-- Happy anniversary. Homer! Hello? Mr. Simpson, it's Karl. Sounds like everything's arrived. Wonderful. You did this? I didn't overstep my bounds? I love you, Homer! I love you, Karl-- Marge. Proceed, Smithers. Our first issue is low productivity... ...and high accident rate. Any suggestions? A round of layoffs. Caffeine in the water cooler. Those are my ideas. You people don't think! I promoted someone in touch with workers. You! You mean him. You. How would you improve the situation? Well, sir, for one thing... we had a problem with fish sticks at lunch. What are you talking about? They chop up the fish into sticks-- I know what they are! Get to the point. You only get this tiny cup of sauce, and I always run out. Stop wasting our time. Shut up! Can't you see? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents' worth of sauce could save us hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib. Let the fools have their tartar sauce. Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys. Give me your plate. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody! Brilliant! Who could've imagined that reforms would pay off so quickly? Accidents decreased by the number Simpson is known to have caused. Output is just as high during his last holiday. My dear, tired old Smithers. Do I detect a note of jealousy? It is time. Give Simpson... the key. Don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer. They've given you the key. The key! Stunning. Absolutely stunning. I was watching the DuMont last night and I caught a documentary on Rommel. A man who got things done. Towel, Simpson. Allow me. I said Simpson. Sure thing, Mr. Burns. Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me. Can do, sir. "$1000. Dimoxinil. To keep brain from freezing." Now I've got you, Simpson. Between your hair care and wardrobe, we're not saving for a rainy day. Rainy day? There's never gonna be one. There's not a cloud in the sky. What does my little girl want? An absence of mood swings and stability in my life. How about a pony? Okay! I want you to weave your magic with my executives. A short speech, "Work. Work. Work." Okay. Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson. It's my sad duty to report... an executive has bilked you out of $1000. What? Blast his hide to Hades! And I was going to buy that ivory backscratcher. How? He charged Dimoxinil. It's a baldness cure. Thank you, professor. I know what it is. Make an example of this hooligan. With pleasure, sir. You've got to help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make a speech. What do you want? I came by to tell you you're fired. Our company doesn't look kindly upon insurance fraud. Clean out your desk by noon. Wait, Mr. Smithers. Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this. What are you saying? Mr. Simpson was unaware. I take full responsibility. Really? Well then, you're fired. Whoever you are. Here's your $1000. What do you care if this guy's bald? My reasons are my own. Karl, you saved me. Why? Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what any soldier would do when a grenade threatens his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt. Thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say. Just walk me to my car. Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you. Bye, Mr. Simpson. Did you bring an umbrella today? D'oh! No. Here. You're broke. You don't have Karl. He's not here. But you've got your hair. Oh, that big speech! Hey, what's happening, hepcats? No way. It's gotta be a fake. It's like reals-ville, daddy-o. What are you doing? You little--! Now I've got you! Boy must die! I love you, Dad. Dirty trick. I won't kill you. But I'll tell you three things that will haunt you forever. You've ruined me, you've crippled your family and baldness is hereditary! It is? Why don't you call the pharmacy? I don't have $1000! But you do. You've been squirreling it away. Saving it for a rainy day, right? Dad's taking this in a less than heroic fashion. Oh, Homie. I'm so sorry. Got that speech in five minutes. You're not going to hang yourself? Dear Mr. Simpson... I've prepared your speech on 3-by-5 cards. The big words are spelled phonetically. "Phonetically." God bless you. You are one of Springfield's special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir. That wasn't just a voice inside my head. Why are you here? I came to say bye to the gals. Thanks for the speech. But I can't give it. Look at me. I haven't taught you anything! What? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key, drying your boss's hands. It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could. I'm a big fool. No, you're not. How do you know? Mother taught me never to kiss a fool. Karl. Now go get them, tiger. And now with some insights, one of the stars of our nuclear family... Homer Simpson. Who is that old geezer? What's he done with Homer Simpson? He is Homer Simpson, sir. You'd think I was crazy if I did this. He's crazy! Yet this company does this every day. Bloated inventory, outmoded production methods. I can save this company millions a year. How? Jiko Kanri, the art of self-management. This bald man has no ideas. lf it's a joke, I'm not laughing. Telling us how to run things. He doesn't have hair. Mining uranium that could be purchased on foreign markets. The long-term benefits more than... offsetting the one-time cost, for a net savings of $5-- Lots of money. Mr. Burns' office, right now. Dead man coming through. Well, well. Our dashing, young junior executive. You made a mockery of our meeting. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to. Why? How old do you think I am? I don't know. 102? I'm only 81. You may find this hard to believe, but in my salad days... my glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls. I was big man on campus until my senior year... when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. I too know the sting of male pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back. What? Oh, thank you. Get out of here before I reconsider. Better hurry up. Are you still awake? I've never been more awake in my life. What's wrong? Are you kidding? I'm stuck in a dead-end job again. The kids will hate me... because I can't buy the stuff I promised. And you're not going to love me because I'm ugly and bald. Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table. And the kids will get over it. And? What about loving me? Oh, Homer. Come here. What? Come here.
#02x03^Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a strange holiday. I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on TV that are inappropriate for children. Things like the next half-hour. Nothing bothers my kids. But tonight's show, which I wash my hands of, is really scary. If you have sensitive kids, maybe you should tuck them into bed... instead of writing us angry letters. Thanks for your attention. Tree House of Horror What a haul this year. I love Halloween. Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to. And the policeman on the phone said: "We traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you! Get out!" But it was too late. End of story. I heard that in the third grade. It's not scary. Is too. Is not. Is too. Is not. Fine! Then you tell one scarier. Flashlight, please. Here's a story that's scarifying. Oh, brother. I call it, "Bad Dream House." That's all. Sign here. There you are. And a dollar for you. A buck. I'm glad there's a curse here. Huh? Well, it's all ours! I can't believe how cheap it was. Motivated seller. Well, he must have been motivated. Prime location, 18 rooms, moat. We shouldn't be able to afford this. So we got a deal for once. Quit fighting it. It just seems too good to be true. Mom! Bart threw a book at me. Did not! Did too! Get out. What on earth was that? Oh, just the house settling. This kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch. Homer! What's this in the corner? I don't know. Looks like a vortex. A gateway into another dimension. Ooh, a vortex. Catch! Hey, pretty slick. "Quit throwing garbage into our dimension." Mom! Dad! Help! Get out! Okay, boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one. I can feel an evil presence in here. Evil? Quiet. You're scaring your mother. Children, get your coats. We're leaving right now. Wait. It's only natural there would be things wrong with a home like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? We get some priests-- I won't live in this evil house just to save money. Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars. We're talking a few thousand dollars! It's got great high ceilings! Tell you what. Let's sleep on it. Okay? All right. If anything happens-- What could happen? They are all against you, Bart. You must kill them all. They all must die. Are you my conscience? I'm-- Yes, I am. Lisa. Lisa. The butcher knife, Lisa. They are all against me. They all must die. Marge. Oh, Marge. I'm in the kitchen, Homer. Die! Die! Everybody die! What's going on out here? Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it! Sorry, Dad. Sorry, Bart. Sorry, Mom. We're leaving. You said you'd sleep on it. I don't care. This family has had its differences... but we've never had knife fights. I blame this house. Mom! Dad! Look! It's an ancient lndian burial ground. Man, this place has everything! An ancient lndian what? Mr. Plott? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me the house you didn't mention one thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an lndian burial ground! No, you didn't! That's not my recollection! Yeah? Well, all right. Goodbye. He says he mentioned it. Let's go, kids. Ah, Marge. Homer! You will die. You will die slowly. Your stomach will swell. Your intestines will writhe and boil. Your eyes will burst and some horrible stuff... possibly your brains, will start coming out through your nose. Shush! Shut up! Quit trying to push us around! Stop saying those horrible things and show some manners! Look. I've never been so angry. My hands are shaking. Better than your eyes bursting. Do it again. What? Make the walls bleed. No. We own you. Let's see some blood. I don't have to entertain you. Do it! Do the blood thing. Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it! Why are you scaring us? To keep us from getting close... ...and maybe even loving you? Leave me alone. Don't talk that way. Hey, listen, lady-- Oh, don't call me lady. My name is Marge Simpson, and we're not going anywhere. We're going to have to live together, so you better get used to it. Please. Can I think about this? Sure. Life with the Simpsons. What choice do I have? Wow! Bitchen! It destroyed itself rather than live with us. You can't help but feel a little rejected. That wasn't scary. Oh, yeah? Well, how about this severed finger! Eww! Baby spit! Well, that last story was a warmup for this macabre tale I call: "Hungry Are the Damned." Homer, all these flies. Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper. Ooh! That was a big mama. That should do it. Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection. Cool, man! The burgers are getting cold, guys-- Holy moly. Huh? Greetings, Earthlings. I am Kang. Do not be frightened. We mean you no harm. You speak English. I'm speaking Rigelian. By coincidence, our languages are exactly the same. What are you gonna do with us? We're taking you to Rigel Four. A world of infinite delights to tantalize your senses... and challenge your intellect. Look. To you, we Simpsons are a lower order of life. We face that prejudice every day, but we are happy on our planet. We throw ourselves on your mercy. Please return-- Dinner! Get a load of that spread. Here you go. Take all you want, but eat all you take. Thank you, Mr--? To pronounce it correctly, I would have to pull out your tongue. Fried shrimp. Sloppy joes. Smothered pork chops. Look! Radish rosettes. These are hard to make. They're an advanced race. Come, Earthlings, eat. Grow large with food. Something's not quite right. The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce for these pork chops! What are you looking at, buddy? Your wife's quite a dish. Thanks. It's our pleasure to provide you with entertainment on your journey. We get over a million channels from the far reaches of the galaxy. Do you get HBO? No. That's extra. Here's our achievement in amusement technology. An electronic version of table tennis. Your paddles have been replaced-- That's just Pong! Get with the times, man. We played that before marriage. We did build this spaceship. Anyone that has mastered intergalactic travel, raise your hand. All right, then. Sorry. Your game is very nice. Dinnertime. How come you guys never eat? Oh, we wouldn't want to spoil our appetite for... the feast when we land on Rigel Four. Ooh, a feast. Will we be invited? Oh, you'll be at the feast. I have a feeling you'll be the guests of honor. Tell us more about this feast. No, eat now. When we arrive, there will be plenty of time to chew the fat. Very good, Earth boy. Excellent, Mr. Simpson. Excellent. This will give the humans the perfect flavor. Stop! Don't you see what's happening? They're fattening us up so they can eat us! Lisa. Oh, come on, Lisa. If you don't believe me, look at this book I found. She's right. You have stopped eating. Listen, you big stupid space creature! Nobody, but nobody, eats the Simpsons. I beg your pardon? We found your book. You mean this? It's a harmless cookbook. It's just a little dusty. Wait a minute. Wait, there's still more space dust on here. Let me get this straight. They thought we would eat them. Good God! Is this some kind of joke? No, they're serious. Why were you making us eat? Make you eat? We merely provided a banquet... and you made pigs of yourselves. I slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and-- Well, if you wanted to make Serak cry, mission accomplished. You aren't the only beings who have emotions, you know. We offered you paradise. You would have experienced emotions greater than what you call love... greater than what you call fun. You would have been treated like gods and lived forever in beauty. But, now, because of your distrustful nature, that can never be. For a superior race, they really rub it in. There were monsters on that ship, and we were them. See why we say you're too smart for your own good? Way to go, Lis. Yeah, thanks, Lisa. Hello, something scary happening. Hey, it's Halloween. Put the book away. For your information, I'm about to read a tale by Edgar Allan Poe. Wait. That's a schoolbook. Don't worry, you won't learn anything. It's called, The Raven. Once upon a midnight dreary While I pondered Weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious Volume of forgotten lore I nodded, nearly napping Suddenly there came a tapping As of someone gently rapping At my chamber door Just some visitor-- I muttered Tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more Are we scared yet? Bart, he's establishing mood. Ah, distinctly I remember It is in the bleak December Each dying ember wrought Its ghost on the floor Eagerly I wished The morrow Vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow Sorrow for the lost Lenore Oh, Lenore. For the rare and radiant maiden Whom angels name Lenore Nameless here For evermore The silken sad uncertain rustling Of each curtain thrilled me Filled me with fantastic terrors Never felt before To still my beating heart I stood repeating A visitor at my chamber door And nothing more My soul grew stronger Hesitating then no longer Sir-- Said I Or Madam, truly your Forgiveness I implore I was napping, and you came rapping And so faintly you came tapping Tapping at my chamber door That I scarce was sure I heard you Here I opened Wide the door This better be good. Darkness there and nothing more You know what's scarier? What? Anything! Back into the chamber turning My soul within me burning Soon again I heard tapping Something louder than before Surely-- Said I Something at My window lattice Let me see what thereat is And this mystery explore I flung a shutter With a flirt and flutter In stepped a Raven Of the days of yore No obeisance made he Not a minute stayed he Mien of lord or lady Perched above my door Perched upon a bust Just above my door Perched and sat And nothing more Thy crest be shorn and shaven-- I said Art sure no craven, ghastly ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore Tell me what thy name is-- Quoth the Raven Eat my shorts! He says, "Nevermore." And that's all he'll ever say. Okay. Okay. Then methought The air grew denser Perfumed by some unseen censer Stupid censer. Swung by Seraphim Whose foot tinkled on the floor Wretch-- I cried God lent thee By angels sent thee Respite from thy Memories of Lenore Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe And forget this lost Lenore Quoth the Raven-- Nevermore Be that word our sign of parting-- I shrieked up starting Get thee into the tempest And the night's Plutonian shore Leave no black plume as a token Of the lie thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbroken Quit the bust above my door Take thy beak from out my heart And take thy form from off my door Quoth the Raven-- Nevermore Take thy beak from out my heart And take thy form from off my door Quoth the Raven Nevermore Why you little-- Come back here, you little raven! Nevermore, nevermore Nevermore The Raven never flitting Still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust Just above my chamber door His eyes have the seeming Of a demon that is dreaming The lamplight o'er him streaming Throws his shadow on the floor My soul from out that shadow That lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted Nevermore Lisa, that wasn't scary. Not even for a poem. It was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare. Like Friday the 13th Part I. It's pretty tame by today's standards. Children, bedtime! I guess I'll have no trouble getting to sleep tonight. Oh, no, Marge. Come on, please. I'm not sleeping with the lights on. They're just children's stories. They can't hurt you. Oh, I hate Halloween!
#02x04^So, kids, caught anything? Not yet, sir. What do you use for bait? My brother's using worms... but I feel tranquility outweighs catching fish and use nothing. I see. What's your name? Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you? I'm Dave Shutton. I'm a reporter who's on the road a lot. In my day, we didn't talk that way to elders. Well, this is my day, and we do, sir. All right! We eat tonight! Wait a minute. One. Two. Three. Leave it to old Mary Bailey... to finally do something about that hideous mutation. Mary Bailey! If I was governor... ...I'd find better things to do. Such as? Getting Washington and Lincoln's birthdays as separate holidays. President's Day! What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and-- You're late. Someone will punch in for me. Don't spill anything. Keep the mutants coming! I'll mutant you. Oh, man! Plain cake donuts. Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys! Why can't I ever get here on time? Hi-ho, faceless employees. In a few moments, the government inspection team will be here... so look busy and keep quiet! That's all. Very stirring, sir. Here they come. Hold me, Smithers. Okay. Geiger counters on. That's normal background radiation. You'd find it in any nuclear facility... ...or for that matter, hospitals. Sorry. Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower. I'm as shocked as you. Plutonium rod used as paperweight. Now that shouldn't be. Yeah, well, that's always been like that. Just resting my eyes! Well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee. Monitoring station unmanned. Look here, inspector, could I speak to you privately in my office? Mr. Burns, in 20 years, I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable-- Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands of dollars... just lying here on my table. Smithers, why don't we leave... and hopefully, when we return, the pile of money will be gone. The money and a stupid man are still here. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to bribe me. Is there some confusion about this? Take it! Take it, you poor schmo! Mr. Burns! I'm gonna overlook this felony. However, I will not overlook the 342 violations I have observed today. Either bring this place up to code, or we'll shut it down. Good day. Oh, well. A little dab of paint here, a little spackle there. How much could it possibly cost to fix this place up? Approximately $56 million. 56 million?! Don't hit me, sir. Oh, that I had the strength to. Now please go. I would be alone. Empty. Just resting my eyes! Holy moly! 9:30. Hi, Marge. Sorry I didn't call, but it's been a madhouse here! Yeah, these 12-hour days are killing me. Echo! Mr. Burns? Sorry, sir. It's me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right? Working late, Simpson? Yes, sir. You and I are a dying breed. I'll share something with you. Hop in. Cushy! They're trying to shut us down. They say we're contaminating the planet. Well, nobody's perfect. Can't they just get off our backs? If I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently. You know how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford! I bet you could. Don't get me wrong. You're an honest man. I just meant you could afford to run for governor. I'm just rambling because you keep staring at me, but it's true. If you were governor, you could decide what's safe. Where are we going, sir? To create a new and better world. If it's on the way, could you drop me at my house? He's got my vote. Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family. Mary Bailey won't fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Burns! A political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy! I don't see how that despicable man has a chance against Mary Bailey... our state's most beloved governor. Now, here's the problem as I see it. While Bailey is beloved by all... 98 percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse. So we got the finest campaign team money can buy. This is your speech writer, joke writer, spin doctor... makeup man and personal trainer. Their job: to turn this Mr. Burns, into this. Why are my teeth showing like that? Because you're smiling! Excellent! This is the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. How do we turn Joe Six-pack against Mary Bailey? With this team. Your muckraker, character assassin... ...mudslinger, garbologist. Hello. Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this, into this. Visual aids help so much. Thanks. But first there's a burning issue that we need to neutralize. I hate that fish! Thank you for watching Movie for a Dreary Afternoon. Next, a political announcement from the friends of Montgomery Burns. Burns? Change it. You do it. I did it last week. Fine. Be a jerk. We'll just sit here and watch it. Oh, no! An election? That's when they close the bars, isn't it? Sorry, Barney. I wonder if he'll talk about that fish. Oh, Marge. I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion... you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had. Thirty seconds. Remember to smile. I am smiling. You'll have to do better than that. How's this? There you go! I'll be sore tomorrow. We've done all we can. The rest is up to you. Don't worry. When this announcement's done... every Johnny Lunch-pail in this state will be eating out of my hand. Hello, friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor. I'm here to talk to you about my little friend Blinky. Many of you think he's a a hideous mutation. That simply isn't true. Don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin. Hello. Hello, Charles. Tell them about your theory of natural selection. Glad to. Every so often, Mother Nature changes her animals... giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs... or in this case, a third eye. If these changes are an improvement... the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the earth. So this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may be a kind of super-fish. I wouldn't mind a third eye, would you? No. You see, friends... if our antinuclear naysayers and choose-upsiders... came upon an elephant next to our power plant... they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman. This fish is a miracle of nature, with a taste that can't be beat. So say what you want about me, I can take the slings and arrows. But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky. Good night and God bless. Only a moron wouldn't cast his vote For Monty Burns Wow! Super-fish! I wish the government would get off his back. That Burns is just what this state needs, young blood! I hope we can count on your support. Homer, I'm a Bailey booster. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns booster. Congratulations, Mr. Burns, the polls show you're up six points. Giving me a total of? Six. We're on our way. My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters are gullible fools. I'll rely on their intelligence and good judgment. Interesting. Good luck. And I say taxes are too high! Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey? We went through her trash. Talked to her maid. The only dirt we've got is from a guy who dated her at 16. And? He felt her up. Not good enough! We're gonna send a message to those bureaucrats... down there in the state capital! Is your boss governor yet? Not yet, son. Not yet. The voters see you as godlike. Hot dog! But the downside is you're losing touch with the common man. Oh, dear! Heaven forefend! So the night before the election... we want you to eat at the home of one of your workers. I see. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this godforsaken state... will see me chow down with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day. The only question is, can we find someone common enough? Well, I knew there would be sacrifices. Great toast, Marge! Oh, by the way, the night before the election... ...Mr. Burns is coming to dinner. What!? And some camera crews. Cool, man! A media circus! Absolutely not! Come on, Marge! I'm ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey. Kids, please leave. I don't want you to see this. Please, please, please, please! We'd like one of the children to ask a question. Can you memorize this? "Your campaign's moving like a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?" Very good. Can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet... and making it uninhabitable? The card question's fine. I think her question is valid-- Don't worry. I'm sure she'll be able to memorize it by tomorrow. Finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him... but remember, he hates being touched. Marge, get back in bed. No, I'm fine right here. I just wanna snuggle. I don't feel like snuggling. What's that got to do with it? You don't let me express myself. You express yourself in the home you keep and the food you serve. Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it. All right. Good. That's how I'm going to express myself. Good night. Well, what do we think? Hey! Hello, handsome! Get that off his face. We're eating with the common man, not Tyrone Power. Latest polls are in. It's dead even: 50-50. This stunt will put us over the top. He's here! Hello, Homer. Marge, you look dazzling! And look, I've brought noodle kugel. You bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up. I love dogs. Babies too. Kitty, kitty. Are you all right, Mr. Burns? Of course. A little roughhousing with the pets is good for the appetite. The way you handled the pets put you over the top. You're ahead 5 I to 49. Congratulations, Mr. Governor. Excellent. Bart, would you say grace? God, we paid for all this ourselves, so thanks for nothing. Only a child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen. He's smokin'. You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this controversial issue? I didn't realize this was going to turn into a charged political debate. I was only reading-- I agree. If I am elected governor... I'll lower taxes whether bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not! Lisa, do you have a question for Uncle Montgomery? Yes, sir. A very inane one. Your campaign's moving like a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular? A tough question, but a fair one. There's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity... others to my incorruptibility and determination to lower taxes... and the bureaucrats can put that in their pipes and smoke it! Oh, Mom, that felt awful. I'm sorry. It will all be over soon. But we've become the tools of evil. You're learning lessons tonight... and one of them is to give your mother the benefit of the doubt. or even a square deal. Smells delightful. All right! Three-eyed fish! Can I have your plate? I don't believe it! He's blown it! Ruined before it hit the ground. Here's your headline, "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story." Burns' popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish. You must have a few tricks left up your sleeve. Make coffee. We're not licked yet. Yes, we are. Come on. Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns! Smithers, tip over this table. Yes, sir. Make them stop. Mr. Burns.... Shut up and wreck something! I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions will accomplish. She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful. Ironic. This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes... cost me the election, but if I had them killed... I'd be the one to go to jail. That's democracy. You're poetic in defeat, sir. Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years... that your dreams will go unfulfilled. You're busted, Dad. My dreams will go unfulfilled? I don't like the sound of that. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, can't you make it better? When a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert... occasional snuggling and sleeping in on weekends... no one man can destroy them. Hey, you did it!
#02x05^So, what happened in Capital City? Oh, Barney. We're dying of curiosity. The only thing worse than being a loser... is being a guy telling the story of how he became a loser. I don't want that to happen to me. Please, Homer? Well, okay. It was "Nuclear Plant Employee, Spouses and No-More-Than-Three-Kids Night"... down at Springfield Stadium. I think we lost them. And we're at the ballpark! All right! Two birds with one stone! Okay, everybody out! Some of the players you see may make it to the big leagues. Will we see washed-up major leaguers? Sure, there's a nice mix. There's no better place to spend a balmy summers' night. The grass of the outfield, the brick of the infield... and the chalk lines that divide the man from the boy. Lisa, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in 72-ounce tubs. Space out the tubs this year. What do you mean? Last year you got rambunctious and mooned the umpire. Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat. It also gives me the right, no, the duty to make a complete ass of myself. The Gammills! Good to see you. You're an inspiration to us in Waste Management. Forget about contaminants for one night and have a hot dog. Put a smile on his card, Smithers. Already there, sir. The Simpsons, sir. Well, if it isn't the Simps. Oh, the Simpsons, sir. Oh, yes. Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and Expecting. The card needs to be updated, sir. That's okay. The baby's name isn't important. Let's go. Red Hots! Get your Red Hots here! Flash Bailor! I gotta get his autograph. He was a star. Will you sign my ball? No. Lousy, washed-up, broken-down tub of guts! Who does he think he is? What's wrong? He won't sign my ball. He's a fine role model. Bart, give me that ball. Check out the mature quail heading over. Little lady, what can Flash do for you? Here you go, Bart. "Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26. How about it? Flash." Wow, Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge. Hey, Dad, look! You're on Jumbo-Vision! Hey, everybody! How you doing? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Homer. Homer! X-Y-Z. Examine my zipper? Why? Thanks, everybody. Throwing out tonight's first ball... the man whose name is synonymous with the safest energy source: Mr. Montgomery Burns! They love you. As they should. When I was a young buck... my fade-away pitch was compared to the trouble ball of Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers. One hawker coming up, sir. What a lame-o! I could hear the air being torn, sir. Oh, shut up! Hey, Burns! Hey, rag arm! You throw like my sister! Yeah, you throw like me! To honor America, please rise for our national anthem... sung by Springfield's R & B sensation, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy. Dan Horde, mikeside. Our lsotopes take on the Shelbyville Shelbyvillians. We look to snap the longest losing streak in pro baseball. How about that? We're in the record book! Sitting with the employees proves I'm their friend. Get me an aisle seat. I don't want to be surrounded. Let's go! Swing, batter! We want a pitcher, not an itcher! We want a catcher, not a scratcher! Here we are, sir. Oh, no! Sitting next to the boss. The best night of the year and it's ruined. Of all the lousy, rotten.... It just means you can't wave your fanny in public. Rub it in. Beer here! Duff Beer! Beer. Did you hear that, Marge? Delicious, frosty beer. Fat lot of good it does me sitting next to Burns. Now, Homer. I suppose you want a beer? Me, sir? Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer. I wonder if you'd join me. My treat. If someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm wrong on the subject. Are we having a drug test tomorrow? No. Vendor, two, please. 2.50. The hitter's off his rocker, kissing Betty Crocker! Good one, sir! I used to rile Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park. Little baby batter, can't control his bladder! Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie-poos? Don't mind if I do. Well, Simpsie, up for another wave? All right, Burnsie. Bases loaded, 'Topes have I out, down by 3. Swung on and missed. Strike 3, of course. These banjos couldn't carry Pie Traynor's glove. After Bill McCIoskey pops out, our post-game show starts. Come on! All we need is a grand slam! My one game of the year, ruined by pathetic incompetence! What's wrong with you? Show some spirit! Your team needs you! Come on! As I got up, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle. Some nut's dancing! He has the crowd going. Can he shake up mediocre slugger Bill McCloskey? Swung on and belted to deep left field! Going, going, gone! It's out of here! Oh, my God! The lsotopes win a game! The lsotopes win a game! That was certainly exciting. Yes. But Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the evening. He's banned for life from all company outings. Way to go, Homer. Thank you. You're too kind, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part too. Excuse me. You, the dancing fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara. I own the lsotopes. Would you like to be our mascot? Me? A mascot for a bush-league team? I should've slept on it, or at least stared blankly. If I hadn't thought of a nickname, all our lives might've been spared. Get on the bus, Dancing Homer! Shut up! I'm thinking of a name! Well, I'm ready to punch in. Hey, cool, man! Our lives have taken an odd turn. Did they ask you to dress like that? No, this was my idea. Don't fill up on those vegetables. Save room for nachos. All right! For the first time, people didn't laugh at me. They laughed towards me. 'Topes win! Two in a row! A Simpson on a T-shirt! I never thought I'd see the day. I'll stick this where the sun don't shine. Oh yeah? And where might that be? I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. Give me "Baby Elephant Walk" with a little reggae beat. Go, Dancing Homer! Get up, man! Lively up yourself, Dancing Homer. Bases loaded, two outs. The good guys trail by a run. S-P-R-... -l-N-G-... -F-E-E-L-D! Springfield! Here's the pitch. Swung on and missed. Strike three. 'Topes lose. 'Topes lose. 'Topes lose. You wanted to see me? Now we both knew when you began doing this, you wouldn't be here forever. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot! You make me sick. I'm not firing you. You've been called up to Capital City. Me? The majors? That's right. Wait, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest one there is: The Capital City Goofball. He's getting old, needs someone to fill in a few innings a night. Could be a big opportunity. I'll say! Why don't you talk to your family? Because they might say no. This was a big decision. I should've listened to my kids, not my dumb wife. I shouldn't call her that. Bite my tongue. I can't go! I was born here. I thought I'd die here. It's not so bad. You'll die someplace else. What do I do about friends? You'll make new, better friends. But, Dad, we're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too complex. Everyone here knows us and has forgiven us. I'd be lying if I didn't say this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason God put us on this earth. Yours is dancing on dugouts. You mean--? Let's do it! Let's never look back! Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger. I've gotta convince my supervisor to give me time off. Sure. What would you like? Four, five years? So you're really moving to Capital City? That's right. And all this is for sale? I don't know how to say this, but.... Knock it off. Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too. Not. I don't know. I'll miss you and all, but-- Milhouse, this way, we'll be friends forever. Well, okay. I'll miss you, spit brother. I'll miss you, spit brother. If we had known each other better, my leaving would actually mean something. We have one quick stop, and then it's on to Capital City. I can't believe it. Our baby sister. I'll call every day. Me too. Look. He can use a horn. Oh, shut up! Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life. Little education, bald as a cue ball... 10 years on the same job for the same salary. But today, as I leave for Capital City... I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth. With the fickle fans already forgetting me... I was ready to take the biggest step of my life. Well, kids. There it is! Capital City! Look! The Crosstown Bridge. Wow! Wow. The Pennyloafer! Kids, look! Street crime. Wow, that's service. Look, it's Tony Bennett! Hey, good to see you. Fourth Street and D! The Duff Brewery! Capital City, yeah! C-A-P-I.... Come to bed, Homie. Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous. We would talk about it always: For the first time ever... Marge fell asleep before I did. Okay, here are your tickets. You're with the players' wives. Cheer for me. See you afterwards when you're a star. Bart was strangely quiet. Later, he said he was confused by his respect for me. It wouldn't last. Oh, my God, I don't believe it. It's you! The Capital City Goofball. Hello, glad to have you. If you need anything, just squeeze the wheeze. The 5th inning will be yours. Everyone is settled in, had a couple of beers. It's an important inning. The 5th. It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper in the front. Right, Mr. Goofball. Call me Goof. What's your plan? I dance and spell out the name of the city to "Baby Elephant Walk." Mancini: the mascot's best friend. See you on that field. I set them up, you knock them down. Dave Glass talking at you. We got great weather tonight under the dome. Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Yes, these must be ours. These seats stink! I thought the wives would be closer. This section is for the ex-wives. He had some bimbo in Kansas City. Throw at his head! A free ticket to a big-league park, but I was too tense to enjoy the game. I was too focused on the task at hand. Red Hots! Get your Red Hots! Ooh, Red Hots. Ladies and gentlemen, Capital City's newest sensation: Dancin' Homer! These do taste better at the ballpark. There he is! I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was something! But they didn't care. What is with these people? What's he doing wrong? I don't know. It was so quiet, I could hear each smart-ass remark. He doesn't make me want to cheer. I pity him, making a fool of himself. These cornball antics don't play in Capital City! The only applause I got was for leaving. Mr. Showmanship, the owner wants to see you in his office. I'm sorry, you're not ready. Pick up your check. And put some clothes on! Well, back to Springfield. I can't! Not after I've seen Capital City! I'll wither and die like a flower. Stop it. Don't look too down. It's hard enough for your dad. All right, Homer! Way to go! What a family. My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home, I realized how little that helped. So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad, ape-like dude. Wow. What a saga. You guys are hanging on my every word. I'm the center of attention. It's riveting. Tell it again, Homer. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular. I don't know. They just do.
#02x06^Bust my hump all week. Stupid grass! Supposed to be the boy's job. Now, Homer, Bart's working on his science project. You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work. One o'clock. Still just a potato. Hey, neighbor. The Lord's given us a beautiful day, huh? Hi, Flanders. Doing yard work? Who told? Marge, beer me. Say, Simpson, I've got some time-release granules... that'll get rid of that crabgrass in half a jiff. Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where? There, there, and there's a big patch over there. There's nothing wrong with crabgrass. It just has a bad name. Everyone would love it if it was called "elfgrass." You may be right. Where's my Duff? We're all out. Would you like fruit juice? Don't toy with me, woman. Couldn't help overhearing. I've got suds in the rumpus room, if you'll join me. Okay, what the heck. I've earned a little break. Holy moly, it's beautiful! This is your first visit to our homestead, eh? We've only been neighbors for one, two, three, four-- Eight years. There's my little popcorn ball. Kissy, kissy. Hello, sponge cake. In case you're hungry, I made club sandwiches. Ain't she wonderful? Forgetting something? Your beer. Is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week. This is a tasty lager from Holland. Beggars can't be choosey. Dad, thanks for helping me with my science project. Sure, study buddy. I've got the best dad in the world. Now you know how that embarrasses me. I know. Toodley doodley. Kids can be a trial sometimes. Knock it off! Knock what off? You've rubbed it in the whole time. Your family is better than my family. Your beer is from farther away. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand. I wouldn't stay on a bet! One for the road. Homie, quit tossing. Sorry, Marge. I'm just steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy bragging know-it-all showoff. What did he say? Get this. He said that-- He said.... Well, it was how he said it. How did he say it? He.... Was he angry? No. Rude? It wasn't how he said it either... but the message was loud and clear. Our family stinks. I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say... he's always been a perfect neighbor. He's perfect now, is he? He's not perfect, but he is nice. Don't backpedal. You were right. He's perfect. Perfect in every way. I'm just gonna walk around the block to calm down. I'm not perfect, like Ned Flanders. Neddie, you're tossing. What's the matter? I feel awful. I forget that we have it better than the Simpsons. I drag him over, he has a beer. Can't blame him for erupting. Then I turn into a snarling beast. I flunked the turn-the-other-cheek test. Maybe I'm not who you should talk to. You're right. Hello, Reverend Lovejoy? This is Mrs. Lovejoy. Just a minute. Honey, honey, wake up. Ned Flanders is having a crisis. Probably stepped on a worm. Hello, Ned. I'm sorry to bother you, but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19: 19. Huh? "Love thy neighbor." Oh, Matthew 19: 19, yeah, right. Ned, the Good Book says a gentle answer turneth away wrath. That is a jim-dandy idea! Bless you, Reverend. "Dear Neighbor...." Flanders! I don't blame you for being upset. I just wanted to give you this. I'll leave now. "Dear Neighbor...." "You are my brother. I love you. And yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom." "Bosom." Wait, wait, there's more. That's awful. He opens his heart, and you laugh at him. "Neighbors forever." Oh, no. "Ned Flanders." What a sap. Read the bosom part again, Dad. Now, just a minute. Bosom. Bart! I wish we were as close as the Flanders. Okay, she's right. Let's do something together. How about some miniature golf, followed by frosty milkshakes? All right! I was going to wash my hair. I'm studying for the math fair. If I win, I'll get a protractor. Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go. Fore! But I got it in the middle. D'oh! That was practice. Play it where it lays. There's Homer Simpson. What a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter. Give up, there's a six-stroke limit. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, please, please go in. Please! Hi, Simpson, having fun? What are you doing here? Mini-golfing with Todd-meister. Hi, Bart! Get bent. Since we're friends, how about a foursome? Okay. Great.... Fun. You looked like you had some trouble. Jack Nicholson couldn't make that shot. It is difficult. The best strategy is to play conservatively. Hug the rail. It won't go in, but you set up an easy deuce. It went in. Good shot. Luck. Final score: Bart, 41. Homer.... Six plus six, plus six, plus six, plus six-- Never mind. Look! "First prize, $50." "Balloons for everyone who enters." Bartley, thinking of entering? He's entering, and he's gonna win. Aren't you, boy? It's possible. I like that confidence but don't pressure him. Todd's very good. Yeah? The fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day. Come on, boy. Dad, I've never won anything in my life. This is the only time I will ever say this. It is not okay to lose. Stay, stay. Good dog. Keep your head down. Not you, I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through. That didn't work, so move your head and don't follow through. Hey! That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player... what a violin is to the guy-- The violin guy. Now give your putter a name. What? Give it a name. Mr. Putter. Wanna try a little harder? Give it a girl's name. Mom. It's Charlene. Why? It just is, that's why. This is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day spend 15 minutes staring at it... concentrating on how much you hate him... and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene destroy him. Who? I'll show you who she is. Now start hating. Hi, Bart. I overheard you warping Bart's mind. And? Aren't you making too big a deal of this tournament? But this is our chance to show up the Flanderses. Sure, but why do we want that? Sometimes the only way to feel good is to make someone feel bad... and I'm tired of making people feel good. Hi. What are you doing? Who are those guys in chess that don't matter? A blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you mean a pawn. Right. I am a pawn. It's times like this that I'm thankful... Dad has almost no interest in everything I do. Bart, I think I can help you. We begin at the library. Hi, Lisa. Hi, Mrs. Norton. Hi, Lisa. Hey, Ralph. Hi, Lisa. Hey, gang. Bart, this is the card catalog. Let's see. "Golf." "Anecdotes, "Eisenhower and," "Humor, "Japanese Obsession With".... Here it is: Putting. And the most important book of all, the Tao Te Ching by Lao-tzu. We can't afford all this. We're just borrowing them. Oh. Gotcha. Close the logical part of your mind. Okay. Embrace nothingness. Sure. Become like uncarved stone. Done. You're pretending to understand me. True. It's very frustrating. I'll bet. I have a riddle for you. What's the sound of one hand clapping? Piece of cake. It's a 3000-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind. No answer? Lisa, listen up. Try another one. If a tree falls and no one's around, does it make a sound? Absolutely. But, Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it? It is time. The basis of this game is simple geometry. Just hit the ball here. You've actually found a practical use for geometry! What is this? Get down before the neighbors see-- Simpson! I don't care how this looks. He's gonna mop up with your son's butt. May the best man win. "May the best man win." The loser's mating call. Just a minute. My son has a very good chance. Yeah? Wanna bet? I'm not a betting man. I'm a chicken, am I? Right. How's this? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins... against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes. Are you afraid to make a real bet? No, I just-- Simpson, you're starting to annoy me. How about this, Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn. And if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job for once. Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress! You have yourself a bet, you jackaninny! Read that back to me. "The father of the loser--" "Loser" is such a harsh word. How about "the boy who doesn't win"? Oh, man. Fine. "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn... in his wife's Sunday dress." You both have to sign? I hope blood isn't necessary. I'm game if you are, Flanders. Good gravy, what did I do? Straighten your arm. Rotate your shoulders. Dad! Son, all I'm asking is that you try. I'll try. Anybody can try. I want you to win! Homer? Marge, give me your honest opinion. This, or this? Morning! By the way, the tournament is today. And you'd better win. Dad! See you downstairs, boy. That crazy Marmaduke. Eight hole? Octopus, third tentacle. Twelfth? Off the grave. Nirvana? Bliss from oblivion of self. Here you go. A lumberjack's meal for my golfer. Mom, Bart is on a diet of complex carbohydrates. Steak will make him logy. What won't make him logy? Oatmeal. Oatmeal? A racehorse eats oats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby. News flash, Lisa. Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy. Good afternoon. Welcome to the finale... of a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. The cream has risen, the wheat has bid farewell... and we begin the final match with two warriors: The unknown Bart Simpson and Todd Flanders... one of the most skilled 10-year-olds to ever play. Having never received encouragement, I'm not sure how it should sound. But here goes. I believe in you. Thanks, man. Lord, we beseech thee-- It's no use praying. I already prayed, and we can't both win. Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt. Flanders, it doesn't matter. Tomorrow you'll be in high heels. No, you will. Afraid not. Afraid so, infinity plus one. Young Flanders has the honor and will tee off first. It's got a chance. Yes, sir. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling.... And the battle is well and truly joined. Mercy's for the weak, Todd. If one looked up "courage", one might find a photo of these two gladiators. Near the Great Emancipator at the last hole, each has eight strokes. The victor shall drink champagne while his opponent tastes bitter defeat. It's okay, son. You can recover. Remember what Vince Lombardi said! "Lose, and you're out of the family." Neither in best form. This pressure can unhinge the steeliest competitor. This is intense, isn't it? My knees are shaking... I got butterflies in my stomach. But it builds character. Who wants character? Let's quit. Okay. We decided we're equally good. We want to call a draw, man. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw. Forgive this Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display... of gallantry since Mountbatten gave lndia back to the Punjabs. Put it there, man. All right! Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners... and neither of us has to do that wager. Put it there. You're welching on our bet? What? Neither boy lost. "The father of the boy who doesn't win... has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress." But neither-- We-- You have to do it too. Small price to see you humiliated. My best dress. One day I'll be telling this to a psychiatrist. Listen to them laughing. This is so humiliating. I'm never gonna live this down. Damn Flanders. Simpson, I feel silly, but what the hay? Reminds me of my old fraternity days. Oh, my God. He's enjoying it! Shh!
#02x07^Stop fighting with your sister! She took my glue! It's not yours! This is family glue! Stop it! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away! This isn't about glue. He only wants the glue because I'm using it. Oh, yeah? Prove it! Here. Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose. Bullwinkle's antler's sprung a leak. Bullwinkle got a taste of his own medicine. He certainly did, Bill. Wait, what did--? Did that make sense? Not really, Bill. Now I know how the Pilgrims felt. What? Who the hell is that? Bullwinkle. Who's that? Underdog. Don't you know anything? They should use cartoons made in the last 50 years. This is a tradition. If you build a balloon for every cartoon character... you'll turn the parade into a farce. Maggie! I'm about to unveil my centerpiece. It's a tribute to the women who made our country great. See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B. Anthony... and this is Marjory Stoneman Douglas. She worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades. Would you like to contribute something to it? Oh, thank you. Honey, you're in the way. Can't I help? Well, okay. Can you do the cranberry sauce? Yeah! Where is it? The can is in the cupboard. Here? No, the other shelf. Got it. Now what? Open the can. Where's the can opener? It's in the second drawer from the right. No, no, the other one. Oh, I got you. It's broken, Mom. Mom, it's broken. Mom, it's broken Mom, it's broken I don't think that it's broken. Here, let me try. Here you go. Cranberry sauce à la Bart. Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done, Bart. Bart? Those silver-and-blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team. He wants them to lose by less than five points. Kogen's got Wolodarsky open way down field. Oh, what a hit! Yeah, he's out cold, Gil. Yes. They'll feed him dinner through a tube. Hope they can fit a turkey in there. Homer, you should pick up Grandpa. Halftime, Marge. Here comes the cavalry. You promised to be nice to my sisters. I know, I will. You brought food? Just a few things. Swedish meatballs. And my trout almondine. You knew I was cooking a turkey. Which is fine. More power to you. Some people find your turkey a little dry. Now they'll have an option. Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma. It's good to see you. Gotta pick up my old man! Bye! So insincere. How does she put up with him? And now, get set for our fabulous halftime show... featuring the young go-getters of Hurray for Everything! I love those kids! They got such a great attitude! Ladies and gentlemen, Hurray for Everything... invites you to join them in a salute to the greatest hemisphere... the Western hemisphere! The dancing-est hemisphere! Before we sit down to our delicious turkey purée... I have happy news. These people have relatives who wish they could be here: Antonowski, Conroy, Falcone, Martin, Thorsen, and Walsh. Oh, and Mrs. Spencer, you too. Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me. Dad, let's get out of here. What's your hurry? This place is depressing. Hey, I live here! Well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Mom, you made it! How are you?! I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one thing: You never do anything right. Thank you! You're super! In the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs... as Hurray for Everything leaves! A stadium's too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody cares! That's no way to lay a fire! This will roar any time now. A caveman could start it. Dinner! Dinnertime, everybody! The hell with this. Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece. Lisa, my goodness. That's very impressive. Holy moly! That's the biggest one of those I ever saw! I always said she was gifted. Definitely from our side. Right, Mom? Leave me be. How long did that take you? I couldn't tell you. It was a labor of love. It's my homage to some heroes... who may not have fought any wars, but who-- Speaking of heroes, here's mine: Tom Turkey! Yikes! What is that? It's the centerpiece. It's taking up real estate. Stop it! Move it, toots! Mom! I'm sure there's room for both. Let me.... Bart, you're wrecking it! Let go! I worked forever on this! Hey, that got her going! Bitchen! Bart! You don't even care! You don't even care! All right, that's it! Go to your room now! I'll take some white meat to go, and send up the pie. I said now! Mom, do I have to? Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've ruined Thanksgiving! I didn't ruin Thanksgiving, she did. I always get blamed. And Lord, we're thankful for nuclear power... the cleanest, safest energy source... except for solar, which is a pipe dream. Thank you for the occasional moments of love our family's experienced. Not today. You saw what happened! Lord, be honest! Are we the most pathetic family in the universe? Amen. Worst prayer yet. Why don't I go talk to the children? Don't worry, Marge will fix everything. Honey, your food is getting cold. That's all right. I'm sorry about what happened. I poured my heart into that centerpiece! Things like that always happen! I've noticed that. When you feel like coming down, we'll be there. You can come down to dinner when you're ready to apologize. And it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody. Apologize? For what? Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor? They think they can starve an apology out of me? Uh-oh. I mean, good! Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Helper. Come on, give me that. Give me that! Don't! Okay, out you go! Boy, come here. You're a good dog. We don't need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner. Wow! Swanky! Smithers, every year you outstrip yourself in succulence. Thank you, sir. Would you like some yams? No, I couldn't eat another bite. Dispose of all this. I did save room for your special pumpkin pie. It's cooling on the windowsill. Stay here, boy. Mr. Burns? Base command. The intruder is a young male, age 9 to 11. Release the hounds. I saw the best meals Of my generation destroyed By the madness of my brother My soul carved in slices By spiky-haired demons Don't worry. We'll get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it. Cool! The wrong side of the tracks. Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed. You've gotta be 18. Let's see some I.D. Here you go, doll face. Okay, Homer. Just relax. At the risk of losing my voice... let me just say one more thing: I'm sorry I came. When's he going to apologize? He's stubborn. Homer was never stubborn. He always folded instantly. As if he had no will of his own. Isn't that true, Homer? Yes, Dad. Twelve bucks and a free cookie. What a country. Cute little guy. He's coming around. You look a little pale, son. We better get you some food. Here we are. All right! Twelve big ones and free grub! Viva skid row! Hey, it's that anchor dude from Channel 6. He's doing one of those be-thankful stories. We have lots of names for these people: Bums, deadbeats, losers, scums of the earth. We'd like to sweep them into the gutter or to some other out-of-the-way place. Oh, we have our reasons: They're depressing. They're crazy. They smell bad. Hey, listen, man. I'm going somewhere. So every year on one lone, conscience-salving day... we toss these people a bone. A turkey bone. That's supposed to make it all better. You won't find the freeloader or Charlie Chaplin's little tramp here. Pompous, blow-dried, college boy! His girlfriend does the weather. You don't say. Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written. Sounds interesting. "Howl of the Unappreciated" by Lisa Simpson. "I saw the best meals--" It's Bart! What show is this? How long have you been on the streets? Five years. Your family may be watching. Anything you'd like to say? Ha-ha! I didn't apologize! Oh, no! My sweet, little Bart. Give me the number for 911! Thanks for your help. This reporter smells another Emmy. We're rooting for you. Got someplace to sleep tonight, Bart? Yeah, there's this family I hang out with. Sounds pretty sweet. Yeah, I guess it is. See you at Christmas. Guys, unless you feel weird about taking money... from a kid, I thought.... I wouldn't feel weird. I'm comfortable with it. Forget the report? He's down at the Rescue Mission! He's long gone. Can you think of a reason why he ran away? Well, we did kind of yell at him and sent him to his room... and forced him to apologize to his sister. I said he ruined Thanksgiving. Oh, I see. Best Thanksgiving ever, eh, boy? Goodbye. I'm sure Bart will be back. I'd say something comforting, but you know, my voice. Let's go! If I'm not back at the home by 9... they declare me dead and collect my insurance. This is a terrible thing that's happened. But we can't blame ourselves. We can! Children need discipline. Ask any advice columnist. Marge, are we ever gonna see him again? Should I or shouldn't I? Hey, everybody, I'm home. Bart? You're home! Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried! Boy, we were afraid we'd lost you! Welcome back, Bart. I'm sorry we had such a terrible fight. Isn't there something you'd like to say to her? Okay, I'm sorry too. No, no, no! That won't do at all! Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness. Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me! Lisa, I beg of you, please forgive me. Now we can blame him for everything! It's your fault I'm bald! Sorry. It's your fault I'm old! Sorry. It's your fault I can't talk! Sorry. It's your fault America has lost its way. It's all your fault. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry all right. Sorry I came back here! Whoa! My whiffle balls, my water rockets! Jackpot! A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl... Simpson down by six with two seconds left. He's got Simpson in the open. Touchdown, Simpson! The boy nobody wanted just won the Super Bowl! Dear Log, my brother is still missing... and maybe it's my fault. I failed to take his abuse with humor. I miss him so much already that I don't know.... Hey, Lisa! It's me, Bart! Bart? Where are you? I'm on the roof. What are you doing? Everybody's worried. Did they cry? Yes. Bull's-eye! Why did you burn my centerpiece? Come on. Because you hate me or because you're bad? I don't know. I don't know why I enjoyed it... or why I'll do it again! Just tell me you're sorry. Why? The only reason to apologize is if you look... inside yourself and find a spot you wish wasn't there... because you feel bad you hurt my feelings. Leave me alone. Just look! Okay, okay. Looking for the spot. Still checking. This is stupid. I won't find anything. Just because I wrecked something she worked hard at and made her-- I'm sorry, Lisa. Apology accepted. You know, Marge, we're great parents. O Lord, we thank thee... for giving us one more crack at togetherness. Amen.
#02x08^Live from Springfield, the wrestling match of the century! Rasputin, the Friendly Russian. Wasn't he the Mad Russian? History has changed wrestling, perhaps forever. The challenger from Heidelberg, Professor Burnabon Brawn. With a "W." Two titans in their prime. This is going to be one hell of a match! I hope you're not taking this seriously. 5-year-olds know this is as choreographed as ballet. Rasputin's got the reach, but the Professor's got his coma lock. This is gonna be one hell of a match. Look at that showoff, kissing his own muscles. He's spinning the Professor! That's disorienting! Hey, Milhouse, crank it up. That's my seat. Correction, was your seat. But I only got up to go to the can. I don't see your name on this barstool. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! The ref is issuing a warning to Rasputin. Oh, my. Oh, my. Why is this referee permitting this? This Saturday, your life will be changed forever. Saturday, at the Springfield Speedway. "Crusher" Woodard, "The Skunk" Trumane and the Dunk Masters... in the Monster Truck Rally! Plus the amazing, unbelievable, Truck-a-saurus! Twenty tons and four stories of car-crunching, fire-breathing insanity! One night only, at the Springfield Speedway! If you miss it, you better be dead or in jail. If you're in jail, break out! Be there! Truck-a-saurus! I have an announcement. As a family growth thing... we should go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday. Aren't you forgetting something? Monster Truck Rally, growth thing, I don't think so. Lisa's recital is Saturday. I have my first solo. If you miss it, start looking for a child therapist. But Truck-a-saurus is one night only! Cruel fate, why do you mock me? Come on. What time does your truck game start? 8:00, but what does it matter? Lisa's recital starts at 5:00. We can go to both. Marge, you're a genius! Let's have good assembly manners. People! People! Quiet, please! Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents. Welcome to the first in a series of concerts. Series! Tonight, Sherbert's-- Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. Good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long. Remember, children, stay together. Five, six, seven, eight! That was beautiful. Can we go now? Sit down, Homer. How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this? Lisa was great. Her fingering's come a long way. Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all. When's Todd's solo, Dad? It's coming up, son. It's coming up. My son, my son. Come on, Flanders. He's not that bad. I reached him. Drive defensively. The best defense is a good offense. Faster, Dad. Truck-a-saurus awaits! Damn, no spots! I think there's one over there. Dad? Not now, Lisa. Come on. Homer. What? Truck-a-saurus! Where? Where? Pull! Pull, you dogs! Let's see, cracked windshield, melted bumpers... punctured radiator, teeth marks in the trunk. At least there's no frame damage. This check should handle it. Thank you. I'm Leo G. Clark, inventor and operator of Truck-a-saurus. Truck-a-saurus feels very badly about what happened. We'd like you to have a half-bottle of champagne for being such good sports. Thank you. Everyone's so nice here, at the Monster Truck Rally. Look, Homer, champagne! Now, Majestic Undercoating is proud to present: Ms. Monster! Wow, a woman mud pool driver. Another barrier broken. Right on, sister! Let the destruction begin! Hey, they forgot my corn dogs. Give me some nachos, Homer-saurus. Here, Bart-a-saurus. Now, we have a surprise guest. The world's greatest daredevil. He's no stranger to danger. If he's not in action, he's in traction. Captain Lance Murdock! Ladies and gentlemen, and especially little children. I'm glad you're here to witness what may be my grisly death. Tonight, my most dangerous stunt. I will death defy nature and gravity by leaping over this water tank... filled with great white sharks... deadly electric eels, ravenous piranhas, alligators... and most frightening, the king of the jungle... one ferocious lion! I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger... one drop of human blood. On the chance I don't live, let me say... seat belts save lives, so buckle up! This is so cool. Oh, I can't watch! He made it! Bitchen! He's okay, folks! What a fun-filled evening. Ladies and gentlemen, a 10-year-old who's brave and bold! When he's not in class, he risks his ass! The greatest daredevil, Bart Simpson! Bart! Bart! Bart? Bart? We're home, son. Dad, I wanna be a daredevil. Kids say such stupid things. You're crazy. You'll never make it. Spare me your lectures, ladies. Oh, no! He's hurt! Bad! Let's get out of here! My little boy! Come on, Marge, we're mad at him. Are you all right? Better than all right. I got stitches! Probably a scar too. Bart says he got hurt training for a career in death defiance? Yes, we saw a daredevil last night... and monkey see, monkey do. I know something that may discourage this behavior. These children have been hurt doing stunts... they saw on television, movies and the legitimate stage. This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman. His brother hit him with a wrench, mimicking a TV wrestling match. I won't show the horrors of our Three Stooges ward. I didn't know TV was a dangerous influence. It's tragic, but it's a small price to pay for top-notch entertainment. Amen! Has Dr. Hibbert made his point? He certainly has. I learned a real lesson. Thanks, Dr. Hibbert. I did it. Wow! All right! Way happening! Awesome! You're the king! Thank you! How about a hand for these brave animals? Hi, kids. Thanks. Okay, field-trippers. Off the bus. What's the matter? I'm running on empty, Milhouse. You kids like my jumps, and I love you for it... but it's too easy. There must be a challenge worthy of me. Hi, children. Welcome to Springfield Gorge. Wow! Gnarly! I bet you could toss a body in there and no one would ever find it. Otto, I'm gonna jump Springfield Gorge on my skateboard. As the only adult here, I feel I should say something. What? Cool! Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone? Sorry, Bart-dude. It's for emergencies only. I wanna tell them about my jump. Okay. Attention, please. This Saturday I'll be jumping Springfield Gorge. There's a good chance I'll fall to my death. Hope to see you there! Springfield Gorge! You'll be killed! I can't explain it, but I get the same thrill from jumping stuff... that you do from reading. Before you do anything, there's someone you should talk to. Thanks for arranging this. Anything that decreases entertainment-related injuries. You're meeting the world's best daredevil, Lance Murdock. This is Lisa and Bart Simpson. Bart's one of your biggest fans. It's an honor, Lance. How you feeling? Doc, I heard a snap. I'm afraid it's broken. That's all of them. I've broken that dozens of times. I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse? Who should I make it to? Just Bart. To Bart: Thanks for visiting me... at Springfield General Hospital. Your visit was a ray of sunshine... on an otherwise cloudy day. Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock. Wow, man! Thanks, Lance. You're welcome. Take this thing. My brother's gonna jump Springfield Gorge on a skateboard. Could you leave me with the kids, please? Let me start by saying, good for you, son. Good to see kids interested in danger. People will say you're nuts. Maybe they're right. But the fact is: bones heal, chicks dig scars... and the U.S.A. has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world. But Captain Murdock-- Thanks! You're welcome. Tell the nurse it's my bath time. Another fringe benefit. Nurse! Springfield Gorge! We settled this daredevil junk! Squealer. Sorry, but if you got hurt or died... despite the attention I'd get, I'd miss you. I forbid you to jump. You can't. I can and do! Go to your room! There, I did it. I'm glad somebody stepped in and put an end to this nonsense. You can tell me not to do it, but you can't watch me 24 hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm heading for that gorge. He's got us. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead. Homer, you're his father. Reason with him. That never works. He's a goner. Come on, Homer, a heart-to-heart talk with your son. You've got to try. Okay, okay. I'll try. Bart? What are you doing?! Nothing. You were gonna jump the gorge. Maybe. Look, I know I can't stop you. I can only ask you... ...to promise me you won't do it. Okay, I promise. What? You didn't mean that! This isn't a promise I don't expect you to keep. lf you promise, you have to keep it. Why? If you don't, I'll never believe you ever again. Come on. I mean it, boy! Okay, Dad. I promise. I won't jump Springfield Gorge. That's my boy. How did it go? We got a pretty good kid there. Well, he's got a pretty good father. Where is he? He said noon. He's just building suspense. What a showman. Look, there he is! Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old--?! Why, that little liar! I should have-- And I was gonna play pickle. Hey, what gives? I tried ordering you, punishing you, and I even tried reasoning with you. Now, I have to jump the gorge myself. What? Why? You'll see what it's like to watch a family member risk his life... for no good reason! Dad, you'll never make it. Don't you think I know that? Goodbye, son. Wait! Don't do it! I won't jump anymore. I promise! Thank God! Thank God! I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right-- I'm gonna make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Think you got guts? Try raising my kids!
#02x09^A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram. Marge, you make the best pork chops in the world. They're nothing special. The extra ingredient is care. A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric and a whisper of MSG. I'm gonna build you a spice rack! Don't go to all that trouble for me. It's no trouble! I've got a garage full of tools. Hey, kids! I spy ltchy and Scratchy off the port bow! Down in front! Shut up, boy. They fight and bite Fight and bite and fight Fight fight fight, bite bite bite The ltchy and Scratchy Show I knew this stuff would be handy. Let's see now, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. "Volume One: Spice Racks." "Pick up a hammer." Not as easy as I thought it was. Wow! Dad, can you move your head? I can't. It's broken. Where would a child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet? No, Maggie! Bad baby! Keep her away! She's got that crazy look again! So television's responsible. We were watching that. You won't be watching any more. Ever! But if you take them away, we'll grow up without humor and be robots. Really? What kind of robots? I heard about the cartoons. Tough break. Thanks, Nelson. What if you watch it over at my house? Hey, that's just crazy enough to work. You heard me. I won't be in for the rest of the week. I told you. My baby beat me up. It is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. Wise guy. I wonder why the kids are late getting home. How come you can watch cartoons? Because. Because why? I said so. You said so why? I'm trying to work. What are you doing? Cataloging the violence. I don't think adults have ever sat down and watched them before. What kind of warped human being would find that funny? They think this is suitable for younger, impressionable viewers? Yeah, what are you gonna do? I'll tell you. I'll write a letter! Dear Purveyors of Senseless Violence: I know this may sound silly at first... but the cartoons you show to our children... are influencing their behavior negatively. Please tone down the violence in your otherwise fine programming. Yours truly, Marge Simpson. Take a letter. "Dear Valued Viewer: Thank you for your interest in our program. Enclosed is an autographed photo of America's favorite cat and mouse. As to your comments, research shows one person can't make a difference... no matter how screwy she is. So, let me close by saying...." "And the horse I rode in on"! I'll show them what one screwball can do! Everybody's looking at us, Marge. That's what we want them to do, Homer. How long are we gonna do this? I've never changed the world. I don't know how long it takes. lf people take an interest-- Hello, Marge! What is "S-N-U-H"? Snuh. It's "Springfieldians for Nonviolence, Understanding and Helping." It's a crusade against cartoon violence. I can protect my kids, but many others are being warped each afternoon. That reminds me. I've got to get to Milhouse's to play. All right. I'm going to Janey's. We'll be making the most of our childhood years. Have fun. We will. What happens when a child has insanely violent role models like these? The answer is all around you. How many of you were hit with mallets last week? I didn't know they made TV dinners this bad. Can I watch cartoons? No. There's peas in my cobbler. They're everywhere. I guess I'll go and watch cartoons. No! I'm sorry about the dinners. I'll make up for it. Who's up for cartoons? No one! All right. Tomorrow, how about making your patented pork chops? Sure! Oh, dear, I can't. I've got three protest rallies tomorrow. Twenty million women, and I had to marry Jane Fonda. Hi, kids! Guess what, Sideshow Mel. It's time for ltchy & Scratchy! Boo! Hey! Settle down, boys and girls. Or Krusty will bring out his friend Corporal Punishment again. Please, stop it. Who are you people? What do we want? Less violence in kid's programming! When do we want it? Now! They're ruining the show! Stop! Please, stop! Please, lady, be quiet! I'm trying to earn a living here, all right? Stop! That woman. That screwball, Marge Simpson. We've got to stop her. How? Drop an anvil? Hit her with a piano? Stuff her with TNT, throw a match and run? All your degrees and that's the best you can do? You make me sick. Less violence in children's programming! When do we want it? Now! Less violence in children's programming! When do we want it? Now! I'm so funny! Some of these are good. I never knew mice lived such lives. So much brutality. I don't know if I'm having any impact. Don't do that! Hey, don't do that! Take that, you dumb squirrel! Where do they get their ideas? What is it? What? Smartline? Yes, I've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. I'd love to! Smartline! With our local Emmy-winning host, Kent Brockman. I'm Kent Brockman. Welcome to another Smartline. Are cartoons too violent? Most people say, "No! What a stupid question!" One woman says yes. She's here tonight. Marge Simpson. There she is! Also with us for this animated discussion... ...are Roger Myers-- Thank you. Krusty, whose program brings us Itchy & Scratchy every afternoon.... Hi, Kent! And, joining us via satellite from Vienna, the home of Freud... to give insight into the mind, Dr. Marvin Monroe. Let's see what this is about. Here's an example of the work being made at I & S Studios. Hilarious. What's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong with it. Excuse me! He's asking me. I know. Nothing's wrong with it. It's a bad influence on children. Give me a break! That is baloney. And here's why: I did some research and discovered a startling thing. There was violence in the past, before cartoons. Fascinating. There was the crusades. Tremendous violence! Many killed! It went on for 30 years. This was before cartoons? That's right, Kent. So much for your viewpoint. Dr. Monroe, would you care to comment? To me, the high jinks of comic characters... pales in comparison with the problems I run into everyday. I'm referring to women who love too much, fear of winning, sex-aholism. So you have no objection to ltchy & Scratchy? No, not at all. One of my guilty little pleasures is to turn on ltchy & Scratchy... and laugh myself silly. What's wrong with that? Not a thing. Now, for another opinion. Hi, kids! Please. This is your chance to participate in a serious discussion. I'm sorry, Kent. It's just when the camera gets on me-- Krusty! Sorry. We won't settle this tonight. Mrs. Simpson, in the nine seconds left, can you summarize your position? I'd ask the parents concerned about this to write in. Let the cartoon makers know how you feel. I don't believe it. "I won't watch your show, buy your products... or brake if I see you crossing the street." Wow, that's cold. "Dear Sleaze Merchant." Now, come on, that hurts. Gentlemen, the screwballs have spoken. Hello? Is this Marge Simpson? Yes. The Marge who fixed it so cartoons can't be violent? Yes. This is Myers with the writers. How do we end this picture? What's the problem? Itchy stole Scratchy's ice cream-- Make it a pie. Easier to draw. Okay, a pie. Scratchy is understandably upset. We figured he'd grab ltchy... ...and toss him in acid. Oh, dear. But we thought it might be violent, which is wrong now, thanks to you. What's your idea? How do we end this? Let's see.... Couldn't ltchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they'd both have pie. It's different, I'll give you that. A tool every handyman needs. It's a jigsaw! A drill! It's an asphalt spreader! It's 67 tools in one! How much would you pay for all this? $1000! Don't answer yet. Sorry. You also get-- I was watching that! Time for Krusty. We can watch cartoons? Yes, dear. All you want. All right! Turn it up! Hey kids! Time for ltchy & Scratchy! They love, they share They share and love and share Love love love, share share share The ltchy & Scratchy Show! Lemonade? Please. I made it just for you. You are my best friend. Itchy and Scratchy have lost their edge. It's a nice message of sharing. I think it sucks. Thank you, Maggie. This hits the spot. Doesn't it? You make good lemonade. Thank you, Itchy. Wasn't that funny, boys and girls? Well? Wasn't it? Aren't you going to watch the rest? No. Come on. Maybe there's something else to do. But the third bowl of porridge was just right. Hi, kids! What? Is this Saturday? What did you kids do today? We went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big. I went bird watching and saw a grackle. That's nice, dear. Let's finish our soapbox racers. Okay. May we please be excused? Sure. Wow! What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge! The parents owe it all to you. I didn't expect things to change this much. I always knew you'd make the world better. This will be the art event of the century! Michelangelo's David... on a tour of the U.S. Which cities will be in your itinerary? New York, Springfield-- Yes? If we have time, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles. Marge, get the door. What in the world? Get dressed, Marge. Lead our protest against this abomination. That's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece. Filth. It portrays parts of the body which, though practical, are evil. I like that statue. I knew she was soft on nudity. Come on, girls. What is this? What do you want? We want your big ltalian butt out of here! Smartline. With our local host, Kent Brockman. A masterpiece? Or just a guy with his pants down? That's our topic tonight. Why are you against the statue? I'm not. Everyone should see it. Aren't you Marge Simpson, the wacko? Yes and no. How can you be for one form of expression, like our naked friend... and be against another form, like ltchy & Scratchy? Good question. Well, I guess I can't. It's a shame. I hate those cartoons. What do you say to those out there who wish to suppress David 's doodle? I don't know. One person can make a difference but probably shouldn't. Well, I guess that settles that. We will be ending early tonight. Tomorrow our topic will be "Religion: Which ls the One True Faith?" There he is, Michelangelo's Dave. David. What's wrong, Marge? Oh, Homie. The kids have a chance to see great art. But they're watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other. Don't worry, Marge. Soon every kid in school is going to come and see this thing. Really? Why? They're forcing them! Well, isn't that nice?
#02x10^I think the boy's hurt. Just give him a nickel and let's get going! I think we should call an ambulance, sir. Hey, cool. I'm dead! Please hold on to the handrail. Do not spit over the side. Aunt Hortense. Great-grandpa Simpson. Snowball! Do not spit over the side. We told you to hold on to the handrail. We asked you not to spit over the side. Howdy, stranger! I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you? Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the devil! You've earned eternal damnation for your evil deeds. Spitting just clinched it. Hey, I'm innocent, man! Innocent! Everybody's innocent. Okay, let's just pull up your file here. It's a mistake. You're due to arrive when the Yankees win the pennant. Nearly a century from now. Boy, is my face red! Bart! Is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here? Sure, but you wouldn't like it. Okay. See you later. Bye! Remember, lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music! Yes, sir! Dr. Warner, wanted in radiology. He's awake! Oh, Bart! We thought you'd gone away from us. I did go away, Mom! I was miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of hell! And you were there! And you. And you. And you. You I've never seen before. Yeah, I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance. Lionel Hutz is the name. Attorney at law. My card. It turns into a sponge in water. Classy. Would you like to bring legal action against the fiend who did this? The fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. Besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Doctors are idiots! He might have permanent injuries. You may have to wait on him... for the rest of his life! That's the downside. Here's the good part. You can cash in on this tragedy! Excuse me, are you a shyster? How does a nice girl know that word? Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time to discuss this. You're right. When you're up to it, come to my office and we'll talk. Lionel Hutz, attorney at law. Is that a broken neck? Great! Hello, Dr. Hibbert. Hello, Lisa. We've got a nasty bump on our head. Quit it! And a tiny broken toe. Quit it! Is he well enough for me to start mothering him? Better let him rest a while. I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy. Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office now and-- Simpson! Burns wants you to march into his office now! Simpson, at last we meet. Nice to meet you too, sir. My attorneys advised me to pay for running over your child. So I'm cutting you a check. Really? Great. $100. Of course, you'll have to sign a waiver... relinquishing your right to sue. 100 bucks? It's a generous offer, sir, but his medical bills alone-- So extortion is the name of your game? Then you get nothing! I have the finest lawyers in Springfield. Tangle with me, and I'll crush you like a paper cup. Throw him out, Smithers! You don't have to do that. I can throw myself out. Lionel Hutz. In here, Mr. Simpson. Any calls, Della? Calls? Oh, "calls"! The Supreme Court called. They need your help on a freedom thing. Tell them to sit tight. I'll get back to them. This way, Mr. Simpson. You sure have got some education. Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre. Oh, well. Mr. Simpson, the state bar forbids me... from promising you a big cash settlement. But just between you and me, I promise you... a big cash settlement. My fee is 50 percent. 50 percent? You'll be getting more than a lawyer! You'll also get this faux pearl necklace... a $99 value, as our gift. I don't know. You and I might have different ideas... about how big a big cash settlement is. A million dollars? I stand corrected! A million bucks is A-Okay! Now we'll get a real doctor's opinion. Bad news! Your son is a very sick boy. Just look at the X-rays! You see that dark spot there? Whiplash. Oh, no! And this smudge that looks like my fingerprint? No. That's trauma! Am I going to die? Yes, son! Homer! No, of course you won't. Everything's fine. Will I ever play baseball again? No! But I played this morning. That's right, he did. Dr. Hibbert has been our physician for years. He thought Bart was fine. Oh, Dr. Hibbert, from Johns Hopkins Medical School. Mrs. Simpson, you're not a doctor. He's not, I'm not. The only person here who comes close is him. Stop, you're embarrassing me! Are you sure there isn't soft tissue trauma in the face? Oh, yeah. Tons of it. Just say when. A million dollars? Smithers! I want this Homer Simpson fired! Do you think that's wise? Think of the headlines. What about them? They might be critical of you firing him so soon after the accident. All right then. I don't want to seem like an ogre. I'll bide my time. Let him twist in the wind. Slowly, slowly. When the papers have found their new flavor of the month... he'll find out this cat has claws! Good thinking. Now, let's pretend you're on the witness stand. How are you, Bart? Fine. Bart says he's fine. You are not fine! You are in constant pain! I am in constant pain. May I make an observation? What is it? This is a charade to make him look more injured than he is. Maybe Lisa has a point. I don't mind it here, but in court, doesn't he have to tell the truth? But what is truth, if you follow me? Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this? You mean like I'm dead? Sure. The kid's a pro. Springfield Municipal Court is now in session. Judge Moulton presiding. My client's instructed me to remind you how rich he is... and that he's not like other men. I should be able to run over as many kids as I want! I warn you, if you continue to disrupt the court... I'll cite you for contempt. You wouldn't dare! Well, no, I guess I wouldn't. Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson to the stand. Oh, please! Hello, Bart. You know the difference between telling the truth... and telling a lie, don't you? Maybe. Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart? No. Good. Proceed, Mr. Hutz. Thank you. Tell the jury, in your own words... what happened on the day of the accident. Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I played in my childlike way, not realizing I was about to be struck... by the luxury car of death! Defenseless child at 3:00! Luckily, I was not killed. Although sometimes I wish I had been. He's lying! Now, that's believable testimony. Mr. Burns, relate in your own words... what really happened on the day of the accident. Certainly. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining. I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys. Suddenly, that incorrigible Simpson boy darted in front of me. My goodness! Look what's happened! It's not important. Let's drive on. You cold-blooded monster! Regardless of what you think, we must summon help... and comfort him until an ambulance arrives. No! Take me, I'm old! And that's what happened. Why are you looking at me like that? You believed his story! It's looking good, Mr. Simpson. It's looking very good. They hate me? What trial were you watching? Maybe a settlement-- Settlement! Fine! Hang your heads in shame... you overpriced, under-brained notary publics! Just get that ape to my house and we'll buy him off with a banana! And that ugly customer was the last lndonesian rhino on earth. I didn't know you liked animals. I don't like everything about them. Just their heads. Care for some wine, old buddy? Don't mind if I do. Go, go! Bottoms up. There's plenty more where that came from. Are you trying to get me drunk? Yes. Now, old chum... I'm sure you agree this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What say we settle this, man to man? You mean duke it out? No, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a generous cash settlement. A princely sum-- Well, a handsome sum that can end this imbroglio once and for all. Five hundred thousand dollars. Goodness! Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over. Soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what can be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose. What do you think? I don't know. Maybe we should take it and put this ugliness behind us. The fish is in the pan. What do you think? I'll tell you. I think he thinks I'm an idiot! He's offering us this because he knows he'll lose... and have to pay us a million. I feel faint. $500,000! I spit on his $500,000! What's happened to you? All this greediness and lying... and shifty lawyers and phony doctors! Phony doctors? Hello. Know what I'd settle for? The medical bills and an apology. You won't even get that. Offer's expired. We'll let the jury decide. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds. Your Honor, I'd like to call to the stand... Mrs. Homer J. Simpson! Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God? Yes, I do. She was taking that very seriously. Oh, the truth! Mrs. Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to you? Yes, he's been our family physician and friend... ever since I became a mother. He's seen us through everything with competence and loving care. But wait a minute! I'm confused. This court heard expert testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What's your opinion of him? My mother said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything." Will that hold up? No, I've tried. What is your opinion of Dr. Riviera? And let me remind you, you're under oath! To be honest... he seemed more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages... than making him feel better. And he mispronounced words like "abdomen." And his office was dirty! Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's a doctor. And could you describe for us in your own words... Bart's "intense mental anguish and suffering"? Well, I don't know how intense it was... but he did miss three days of school. Although he doesn't like school... so that may not count as anguish. It was hard on me, having him around the house. Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships? We pay Bart $5 a week to take out the trash. I suppose if he'd been able to do it, we might've given him the $5. $5? But your lawyer, assuming he is one, is asking for a million! Well, we can't blame them for trying, can we? Thank you, Mrs. Simpson. I'm going to write a figure down. It's not quite as large as the last one... but I think you'll find it fair. We should take it. A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars. Would you like more macaroni and cheese? A million dollars' worth, you snake-woman! No. String beans? No, you two-timing, backstabbing-- Better answer. No. Celery with cream cheese? Just mouth polite nothings. It would've been cool to get that million. Bart, please. We could've bought tons of great stuff. Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters. Stop me if I'm wrong. Marge, may I go to Moe's for a drink? Sure. I may never come back. Good night. My woman's intuition is telling me something. I wonder-- Oh, my God. Well, I guess this is the class I'll die in. You're better off. Rich people aren't happy. They think they're happy but trust me, they ain't. Moe, I wish he'd shut up. A chick! And it's not even ladies' night. Hey, guys. Knock it off! It's just my wife. Well, hello. My name's Marge. Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing. We've squabbled over money before. Never this much. It's different than when I washed your pants with the 20 in the pocket-- You think this is about money? It's not. It's worse. I'm afraid that when I look at you... I won't see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'll see the dame who blew my one big chance. What are you saying? I'm saying-- She's your wife of 10 years, you've had 3 children. It's time to be honest. I'm not sure I love you anymore. Don't worry, I won't let on. I'll still do the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad. Oh, my Lord! I don't want to wait to find out if you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out. Homer, look at me! Do it if it'll shut her up. Start with the feet. Still angry. Good, Homer! This is tough, need refreshment. Trustworthy beer. My love for you will never die. All right, look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her-- Who am I kidding? I love you more than ever! I love you too! Sorry to scare you like that, babe. Okay, everybody! For the next 15 minutes, one-third off on every pitcher. One per customer, domestic beer only. Hey, no sharing!
#02x11^Is it done yet? It will be ready in 8 seconds. Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four. Three. Two. One. Bing! We have meat loaf! Get it while it's hot, kids. I've got a dried-out end piece with your name on it. Thursday. Meat loaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be. Get to the point. You want me to be open-minded... ...try new things, live life-- Who said that? Nobody wants that. Shut up! Tomorrow night it would be nice... ...to go out for dinner. Friday? Pork chop night? We haven't missed pork chop night since the pig scare in '87! Pork chops. From cradle to grave, etched in stone-- Where do you wanna go? Anywhere but hamburgers or pizza. Fine! We'll go to Mars! There's a new sushi place on Elm St. Sushi? Maybe this is a playground thing, but isn't that raw fish? The playground has the facts right but missed the point. Sushi is considered a delicacy. Can we try it? No. This argument humiliates us both. If I said no the first time, would I say yes the second time? Maybe on the ninety-ninth time. Try me. Please, Dad? No! Please, Dad? No! Please, Dad? Okay! Don't be alarmed. They were saying hello. Okay. Hello! This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty... but soon it will be full of drunken Japanese businessmen. I am Akira. May I take your order? What do you suggest for a family unsure about being here? Sushi Surprise, a bit of everything. Very non-threatening. I'll have one. Make it two. Akira, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel. Do you have killer giant squid? Not today. Sir? It's hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Bring me one of these, one of these and one of those. What do you think? No! The squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame. Good thing I'm open-minded. Not bad. Interesting! I'll try this little pink one here. Very good! And another one. Oh, boy! This fish is delish! Hi, my name is Richie Sakai. I am an anesthesiologist. I'd like to dedicate this song to my wife, Patty. And two of these things. Two uni. I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roll. I recommend the raw quail egg. You're the doctor! There's gotta be something I haven't tried. What's this? Fugu! It's blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one-- Come on, pal. Fugu me! She's here! Cover for me. One fugu. Not fugu. If it's cut improperly-- Yes, it's poisonous, maybe fatal. But cut properly, it's quite tasty. I must get the master. Oh, Miss Krabappel, your hair smells so... ...clean. You're needed in the kitchen. I said cover for me, damn it! Master, we need your skilled hands. My skilled hands are busy! You do it! Poison. Poison. Tasty fish! Concentrate. Concentrate. I want fugu! Fan-fugu-tastic! Beautiful language, isn't it? Don't eat another bite. I couldn't possibly. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you've eaten poison. Poison! What should I do? Tell me quick! Don't panic. There's a map to the hospital on the menu. "Try something new. How can it hurt you, Homer?" Never heard of a poisoned pork chop! Your wife agreed I should tell you. No need, doc. I can read Marge like a book. It's good news, isn't it? No, Mr. Simpson. If you have consumed blowfish venom, and the chef said it's probable... ...you have 24 hours to live. 24 hours? Well, 22. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die! I know. One consolation is that you'll feel no pain until tomorrow evening... when your heart explodes. Death anxiety is normal. Expect to go through five stages. First, denial. No way! I'm not dying! The second is anger. Why, you little--! After that comes fear. What's after fear? Bargaining. You gotta get me out of this. Finally, acceptance. We all gotta go sometime. Your progress astounds me. I'll leave you two alone. Perhaps this pamphlet will be helpful. "So You're Going to Die." Hello, Marge. Hello! I'm the one dying, not you. I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought of what to tell them? Nothing, it'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones. You know what you wanna do tomorrow? Almost. Oh, good! I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I...? When we're intimate? "Be intimate with Marge." Can I make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together? "Watch the sunrise." Till 6 a.m., my dearest darling, on my last day on Earth. 11:30! That's just great! Why did you let me sleep late? You looked so peaceful. There will be plenty of time for that! I got tons of stuff to do! "Have man-to-man with Bart." Come here, boy. Oh, man. I wanna have a heart-to-heart talk! After me, you're the man around the house. So you have to help out-- Lisa never lifts a finger. Go yell at her! Shut up! This is good stuff. I wanna share something with you. The three sentences to get you through life. Number one: Cover for me. Number two: Oh, good idea, boss! Three: It was like that when I got here. This is good stuff. Let's learn how to shave. Finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper... tear off some little squares and stick one there... and there, and any place you're bleeding. There. The blood will hold it on your face. And now, some aftershave. You son of a--! And that's how we shave. You little-- It was like that when I got here! That's my boy! "Listen to Lisa play her sax." Want me to cut out this infernal racket? Let me hear you play. Why? Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay? That's more like it! Oh, I want to be in that rumba When the saints go over there Oh, over there! "Make videotape for Maggie." What a surprise! We were just pulling taffy. The fun never stops here, does it? No, sirree bob! Flanders, can I borrow the camcorder? Okey-dokel! Why don't you guys come over for a barbecue tomorrow? No, thanks. We have a propane beauty... ...in the backyard. No. It's crying out to cook up good food! Flanders, I said-- Tomorrow? Sure! What the hey? I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen. Sounds terrif! The joke's on him! I'll be dead by then. I am trying to.... Is that it? This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hey, Maggie! I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Hope that didn't scare you. Maggie, you're grown-up now. Unless you taped over this, you probably wonder about your dad. He was a simple, kind and gentle man who loved his children and-- D'oh! Hello? Yeah, he's here. Who is this? Milhouse? Bart! Get your butt down here! Dad! It's you. What do you want? We've never been close, have we? Not to my knowledge. Never went fishing, played catch or hugged. We never danced the hootchy-koo either. I just want you to know that I love you, Dad! You do? Uh-huh. Oh, son, I love you too! How about a hug? Dad! Sonny boy! Papa! Junior! My old man. I gotta go. No! We've got a lot of catching up to do. How about we go fishing? Gee. If I wasn't on such a tight schedule.... Let's get some worms. Well, no time for that. I really wanted to do that one. Gee, Dad, hog my last moments. Just a quick game of hacky sack. I love you, son! The old guy's a little love-starved. Move, you hunk of junk! Gotta make up for lost time! D'oh! I'm sorry. I know I was going too fast. Just give me a ticket. Beg your pardon? The ticket! That sounded like an order. I pay my taxes. They pay your salary. When I say give me a ticket, just give me a ticket! Maybe we don't wanna give it to you. Maybe we wanna haul your butt in. Look what else your tax dollars pay for. That's sort of nice. What are you in for? Atmosphere. Okay, Flash. You get one phone call. I can't call Marge. It's our last day together. I can't drag her into this mess. I'll call Barney. Nobody's here! Nobody's here! Damn those answering machine tapes! Thanks! I just wasted my only call on your stupid-- I'm home! I'm home! Hi! Help me. I'm in jail. You are? Hey, Homer, go to the window. Hey, neighbor! I can see you! Get over here. Bring 50 bucks for bail! 50 bucks? What did you do? Kill a judge? Where am I gonna get 50 bucks? Pizza! Why are we all dressed up? Sometimes it's fun to dress up. Why are we using the good china? Sometimes it's fun to use it. Why candles? Sometimes candles are fun. Why wait for Dad? Because we love him... ...and we enjoy his company. Why are we really waiting for Dad? Forty-eight dollars and 70 cents. We don't usually take rusty money. You're dying and you wouldn't even stop to have a beer with your buddies? It was on my list with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss! Check out the luscious pair on that redhead. That's it, baby. Work those ankles! Ring-a-ding-ding, sir. Burns! Eat my shorts! Who the Sam hill was that? It's Homer Simpson. One of the schmoes from sector 7-G. I want him in my office at 9:00, Monday morning. We'll see who eats whose shorts. Of all the luck. I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts. Oh, Homer. Come on! You've got time for one last beer. Please! I gotta call Marge. Moe's Tavern. Birthplace of the Rob Roy. Is Seymour there? Last name Butts. Just a sec. Hey, is there a Butts here? A Seymour Butts? Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymour Butts! Wait a minute. You scum-sucking pus bucket! When I get you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew! It was busy. Moe, another last beer, please. Guys, keep it down. I've got some last words. I never told you, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that-- Oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe! Not in public! You'd better be dying! I love you! How European! Come on! I gotta get home! Faster! Faster! I'm twirling as fast as I can! I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm coming home! Where can he be? Marge! Marge! I don't have an explan-- Love you, love you, love you! I wrote a poem for you this afternoon. It's called, "To a Husband." Okay. The clouds are forming Give me a break. Soon the rain will fall My dear one is departing But first, please heed this call That always will I love you My one, my love, my all That was beautiful! Goodbye, Maggie. Stay as sweet as you are. Goodbye, Lisa. I know you'll make me proud. Goodbye, Bart. I like your sheets. The Good Book. On tape? Oh, it's read by Larry King. I'm Larry King. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. The earth was without.... begat Phinehas. Phinehas begat Abishua. begat Ahimaaz. Ahimaaz begat-- Amariah begets Ahitub. Ahitub begets-- And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children. Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. That's it. Duke Zeibert's standing by. We'll get some matzo ball soup. I love the Spurs. If you're betting, they're gonna win it all. I guess there's nothing more to say but-- Homer? Homer? Oh, Homer. Homer. His drool, it's warm! He's alive! Homer! Homer, wake up! You're alive! Stop it! Wake up! You're alive! What are you talking about? You're alive! I'm alive! I'm alive! And I couldn't be happier! From now on, I vow to live life to its fullest! Three in a row! Let's see that again. Here we go. Excellent wrist action. It was just about to go into the gutter and made a nice spin. Well, if he makes this, he'll be down by 40 pins. The match is far from over. Yes, it is, but his approach has been wrong from the beginning. He's erratic. He tends to explode. In lllinois. Actually, that was Michigan. Well, he's stepping up now. He needs to get at least a spare.
#02x12 - The Way We Was^Do you have to sit so close? It'll hurt your eyes. It will not. Oh, yes, it will. Our next movie is McBain... a shoot-them-up, splatter-fest from the Hollywood cookie cutter. Here's a brainless scene. Senator Mendoza is a respected citizen. Yet you ran his limo off a cliff and drove a bus through his front door? I have proof that he's head of a drug cartel! I don't want to hear it, McBain! You're out of here! That makes two of us. All right, McBain! Cool! "That makes two of us." Are we talking about the same movie? McBain was a nonstop roller coaster of chills, thrills, spills and kills. That chase at the end-- That movie stinks like your creepy apartment. Your mother didn't think so. Real mature-- I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard. What gives? Dad, do something! All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery! Looks like you lost the patient, doc. Shut up. Cheap Chinese TV, why'd I ever buy it? Is that better? No! How's this? Oh, no. Okay. Just everybody remain calm. If you look close, you can make them out. Yeah, I think I can. You're staring at a dot. She's right! She's right! Oh, how I miss TV! Dear God, give me one channel! It's not the end of the world. Before we got married, we hardly watched TV. You lie! It's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool and go dancing. How romantic! And we'd stay at home and talk, like this. I ain't loving it. It's hard to picture you at the crossroads of life. So many questions. Pick one. Okay. How did Dad propose to you? Oh, well.... I think we found the reason why you've been throwing up in the morning. Congratulations. D'oh! I'd rather tell you a different story. How your father and I first met and fell in love. We were seniors in high school, but we'd never met. Gross. Hey, Homer, you're late for English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Let's smoke. I'm for equal rights, but do we need an amendment? Don't you deserve to earn as much as a man who does the same job? Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math. Oh, Marge, you really ought to read this. The shop kids are smoking again. We're late for wood shop! Let's go grab a burger. Boy, you don't gain a pound. It's my metabolism. I'm one of the lucky ones. Well, if it isn't Simpson and Gumble, Springfield's Cheech and Chong. Three days of detention. You know where and when. 3:00, old building, room 106. I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife... who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost $48,000 a year. Right on, sister! The first step is to free ourselves from these male-imposed shackles! Yeah, mama! Take it off! I didn't think it'd burn so fast. It's the paper. Ms. Bouvier, I am surprised. One day of detention. You know where and when. No, I don't. I've never really-- 3:00, old building, room 106. Hi, Estelle? Will you go to the prom with me? I wouldn't go if you were Elliott Gould! Shot down again. Don't worry, it's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody wants to take. Excuse me, is this room 106? Hey, who's that? I don't know. Hey, would you like to go--? She's mine! So what are you in for? I'm a political prisoner. Every day, I show up, act like me and they slap me in here. Simpson, be quiet! I haven't seen you in school. Okay, Simpson. What? Another day of detention! Let's get together. Two days! What's your name? Homer. Three days! J. Simpson. Five! It was worth it! Six days! Okay, Simpson, to the back of the room! Love at first sight! Jailhouse romance. I reached step one. She knew I existed. The problem was, she didn't care. What's the matter? Nothing. Usually, I have to wrestle the bucket out of your mitts. Dad, I'm in love. Why don't you grab yourself a beer? But, Dad, I don't drink-- Cut the crap! "I collect the cans." Now grab a beer and get me one too. This girlfriend, is she a real looker? A lot on the ball? Yeah. Oh, son, don't overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl! I blame myself. I should've had this talk a long time ago. Thanks, Pop. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P-- S. I need some guidance, counselor. Okey-dokey. Good Lord, you should've come to see me a long time ago. I met this girl, Marge, and I wanna force her to like me. That's not the type of guidance I give. I like to think I do something helpful for every student. The only advice I can give you is to share common interests and spend. What interests does she have? She's active on the forensics team. They meet in room 219. Far out! Do you have plans after graduation? Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night! I meant career-wise. That nuclear power plant will be opening soon. It's an outfit that won't require a college education. Me, in a nuclear power plant. Kaboom! But bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. Now, the more you help him, the more you hurt him. Woe unto Shelbyville, should they underestimate our strength. Thanks, Artie. I'd like to sign up for something. We've an opening on the debate team. Arguing? I'll take that, stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein. The topic is "Resolved: The speed limit should be lowered to 55 mph." Fifty-five? That's ridiculous! Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late! Why don't you take "con"? No way. Our speed limit is an anachronism-- Ignoramus. Will you shut up? That word you call me-- Ignoramus? It means I'm stupid, doesn't it? Stupidity is different. Not to me. Ignoramus. You are. Would you like to do your rebuttal? With pleasure. Ay, carumba! You may not remember me. I mooned for rebuttal. Yes, I remember. So you wanna go out with me? Well, I don't think you're my type. You see, the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan. And ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumble! I don't know. I'm not asking you to like me or let me touch your goodies. Just be fair. Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah. Junior varsity shot-putter. I think if he applies himself, trains real hard, he could go another foot. I had him for four years. Solid "C" student. Made a lamp last year. He's all things to men and maybe to a lucky gal. Wanna go to prom with me? Good God, no! Well put. Well, what's the good word? I'm sorry. You seem like a nice guy. But I really don't have the time. And the forensics championship is coming up. So? And I tutor part-time. You tutor? Anyone can be tutored? Only in French. French? What a coincidence! Just the subject I'm having trouble with. Why, you cagey old dog! Great story. Work, damn you, work! Bart! You may be telling this one day if something breaks. Lost a few. There's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo. The perfect crime. Why is there make-out music on? It helps me study. Not me. Shut it off and let's get down to business. Crayon. Bien! Fenêtre. Bien! Femme. Très bien. I should be going. I have a big forensics meet tomorrow. Wait, wait. Don't go. Wait. Wait. Why don't we take a little study break? Do the hustle! Keep it down! You're amazing. Now you can conjugate all the regular verbs... two irregular verbs, and sing "Alouette." Bien. I can't believe it. It's sticking. You're telling me new stuff and minutes later, it's still there. When I see you forming vowels and continents-- Consonants. With your beautiful mouth and teeth-- Merci, I guess. Marge, would you go to the prom with me? You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension. I'll take that as a compliment. Will you go out with me? Say oui. Oui. This will be the greatest night! I've been saving up, but I'll spend it all on us! I'll rent a limo! I'll buy you a corsage! My tux will have the widest lapels and the highest platform shoes. Maybe I'll wear my hair up. Wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not in any French class. This was a brilliant scheme to get to know you. You knew the City Forensics Finals are tomorrow... and you kept me up until I a.m. Pretending to be stupid! Homer J. Simpson, I hate you! Hey, Barney. Guess who's got a date for the prom?! I know this story doesn't end with you telling it to us. They married, had kids and bought a cheap TV. Bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. Now, the more you help him... Terrible. ...the more you hurt him. Congratulations, Artie. This may not be an appropriate forum for what I'm about to put forth... but would you go to the prom with me? I can think of many cogent arguments. The first is from Time magazine: "America's Affair With the Prom." "Even wallflowers can date--" The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years. I'll go to the prom with you. If you pinch your cheeks, they'll glow. Try to break some capillaries. Couldn't we just use rouge for this? Ladies pinch. Whores use rouge. Is Marge here? Who--? Or what are you? I'm her date. I suppose you wanna come in. Okay. Marge's dates always get homelier. That's what you get when you don't put out. I usually insist on approving Marge's dates, but you're a solid citizen. Thanks, Mr. B. Here she comes. Get the camera ready. Homer? What are you doing here? You said you'd go with me. I said I hated you, and we haven't talked since then. I was afraid you'd cancel so I stayed away... even though it meant skipping school and graduating this summer. I'm Artie, Marge's date for the prom. Well, hello. Well, hello, hello. Don't we look handsome? Indeed we do. Come in, young man. Wait a second. If he's your date, who are you? I'm a spare. Excuse me. Now that that unpleasantness is over, let's take a picture of the couple. Say "Cheez Whiz." Hey, buddy, where's your date? She's with him. I guess you want me to take you home? I paid for this car, tuxedo and the two dinners! We're going to the prom! Prom, it is. Don't dance too closely, now. Have a good time. Wait a second, is that a bong? You have asthma? All right, move along. I thought you dropped out. You wish, Dondalinger. That's Mr. Dondalinger. Steak or chicken? Both. Coming through! Barney! He's bought himself a decade of detention. Children, we've tabulated your votes. The king and queen of Springfield High School's class of 1974 are... Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier. Oh, isn't she great? Hail, Queen Marge! Long live the queen! Hello, classmates. Instead of voting for an athletic hero or pretty boy... you have elected me, your intellectual superior, as your king. Very well said. Your king and queen will share their first royal dance. Why do birds suddenly appear? Every time you're near? I've gotta get out of here. Homer? What? Why are you doing this? Why can't you accept that I'm here with someone? Because we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought, there's others. Something says yes and no. This time, it's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about be wrong? I don't know, but it is. Where to now, Romeo? Inspiration Point. I'm only paid to drive. Artie, I don't know. It was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it. Just this. Artie, please. Come on, kiss me. Please. No, really, I mean it! Now stop it! I'm sorry, Marge. Take me home. It's 1:00. If you wanna keep me, I'm afraid it's gonna be $45 an hour. No, it's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk. Yeah, why spoil a perfect evening? I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I'm so respected... it would damage the town to hear it. Good night. Yeah, right. When Simpson showed up, it took years off my life. Stop it. She went out with the good one. Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go! All right! All right! I'll walk in the mud! Homer? Marge? Yeah. You want a ride? Sure. When I got home, I realized who I should've gone with. Who? Oh. Hi, prom date. Marge, pour vous. Why so glum? I got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you... and I'll never let you go. And I never have.
#02x13 - Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment^Evening, Carver of Graven lmages. Homer the Thief. How's business? Been a little slow. Not much to steal in the desert. Do not worry. We'll be wandering out here another two weeks, tops. Zohar the Adulterer. My wife sends her regards. Yes, she's a good woman. Very good. Thank you, my lusty friend. Moses is back. Quick! Everybody, look busy. The Lord has handed down to us 10 commandments by which to live. I will read them in no particular order. "Thou shalt not make graven images." Oh, my God! "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Well, looks like the party's over. Hey, Moses. Keep them coming! "Thou shalt not steal." Sorry, Homer. That's the most dishonest thing I've ever heard! I should box your ears! You sneaky Pete! Easy, tiger. You, easy. Get off my property! Flanders, who put that bug up your butt? I wanted to subscribe to the arts and crafts channel. They sent this man to install it. You know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every channel for $50. Boy, what's this world coming to? That's exactly-- Gotta go. Hey, stop, cable man! Stop! What do you want? I want free cable! This is okay. Everybody does it, right? What? If you're having second thoughts, read this. "So You've Decided to Steal Cable." "Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are faceless corporations which makes it okay." The clown that will last a lifetime. Cable. It's more wonderful than I dared hope! Don't you hate it when you go to the toilet... and there's no toilet paper? It's funny because it's true! Oh, hey! Family! Family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable! Cable?! Right. 68 channels. MTV for the kids. VH1 for us. 1600 hours of quality programming every day. We've talked about cable before. You think we can afford it? Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that. Is this legal? Don't worry. Look at this. "Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies." Fact: Most movies on cable get two stars or less... "...and are repeated ad nauseam." I don't know. Marge. Hear Me Roar, the network for women. We'll teach you to lower your bill by making your own Band-Aids. Oh, that's a good idea. Before we begin, you'll need 5 yards of sterilized cotton. Pro wrestling from Mexico. Down there, it's a real sport. This is where Jaws eats the boat. Here, Die Hard jumps through the window. This is where Wall Street gets arrested. If I could call your attention to the Subsidy Appropriations... Override Bill. I refer you to page 4500-- They think people watch that. Live, from New Orleans. This is the World Series of Cockfighting! Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou tonight. We'd get there quicker if I drove my dad's car. Aren't you ready for church, Homer? Huh? What? Okay. Today's Christian doesn't think he needs God. He thinks he's got it made. He's got his hi-fi. His boob tube. And his instant pizza pie. Oh, pizza. Children, I don't want you to get frightened but I must teach you this. Today's topic will be hell. I sat through mercy and forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff. Hell is terrible! Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket. There's a lake of fire burning with sulfur. You'll be tormented. If you actually saw hell, you'd be so frightened you would die. Miss Albright? Yes. Won't you eventually get used to it? No. Yes. Are there pirates in hell? Thousands of them. Oh, baby! So there's a downside to the afterlife. How does one steer clear of this? By obeying the 10 Commandments. Ten simple rules that are easy to live by. What did you children learn about? Hell. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell... ...unless I say "hell." He has a point. Hell, yes! Hell, hell, hell, hell.... Bart! You're no longer in Sunday school. Don't swear. Hey, anybody up for a little so-called pay-TV? Are you sure this isn't stealing? Read the pamphlet. Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from Cry Yuma and Here Comes the Coast Guard! I'd like to talk about a candy that cleans and straightens your teeth! A program-length advertisement! Wait a minute. I'm confused. Did you say "cleans and straightens"? There's no confusion. Just good science. Ladies and gentlemen, the inventor, Dr. Nick Riviera. Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr. Riviera! Now, could I have a volunteer? Somebody with crooked, yellow teeth. Come on, Lisa. Watch a little cable with us. It won't cost you a thing. Except your soul! What's gotten into Lisa? Beats the hell out of me! What are you doing? What do you mean? Remember the 8th commandment? Of course. Thou shalt not.... Covet... graven images. Something about covet. Thou shalt not steal! Anything else? Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them. Two grapes? Who cares? Just charge me something, please. Okay. I need a price check on two grapes. You heard me, Phil. Two measly, stinking grapes. If you didn't catch it in the theater or rent it... we've got it! On the Blockbuster Channel! Why is the world a cesspool of corruption? Oh, great. All right, what makes you say that? In Sunday school we learned stealing is a sin. But everybody does it. We're stealing cable. Did you pay for your breakfast? No. Did you pay for your clothes? No, I didn't. Run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the feds! I think that's pretty spurious. Well, thank you, honey. Friday night, live. The ultimate matchup. The bout to knock the other guy out. Watson-Tatum Two. This time it's for money! Oh, boy! Only on the Blockbuster Channel. How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness? Big fight coming up. Wanna come over and listen to it on the radio? Okay. After the fight, we can watch the still photos on the news. Not too shabby! What do you say? We could do that, yeah. Or we could go over to my house and watch it live on cable TV! Get off! You're kidding me! Pass the pumice, please. He's Homer from sector 7-G. Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs. Tatum Two... I'd even go to an employee's house. I can picture it now. The screen door resting off its hinges. Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die. May I speak frankly? Yes. You are quite wealthy. Thank you. Your candor is refreshing. Why don't you pay for the fight yourself? The big fight is one of those rare occasions that I savor the sights... the sounds and the smells of other men. You haven't lost the common touch. So, Homer, I hear you got the fight. That's right. 8:00, my place. Come one, come all. All right. Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar? Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull. I made my choice and I stand by it. Somebody's having a party. Friday night. Wanna come over? No, thanks. I'm open 24 hours. It puts great demands on my time. Too bad. It'll be a great fight. The fight! I'll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me. He deplores violence. If a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that's stealing? No. It is if he puts anything on it. Jelly, for example. I see. You're here for a reason. Is your father stealing bread? I don't watch him every minute. But we're getting cable for free. I'm afraid that is stealing. I think you must do something. Should I have him arrested? That seems like an ideal solution. But remember the 5th commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother." I would like to see you set an example by not watching... ...the offending technology yourself. Thank you. You're watching Top Hat Entertainment. Adult programming all day, every day. Except in Florida and Utah. Coming up next, Stardust Mammaries. Ay, carumba! Bart! Here's what I was looking for. Blue chips closed up 3 3/4. Oil service stocks slumped.... You shouldn't watch that other channel. It's for mommies and daddies who love each other. Promise me you won't ever watch it. Okay. Promise me. I promise I won't watch it. Good boy. Hi, Dad. Stealing cable is wrong, so I'm not watching it... in the hope that others will follow my example. Thank you. Hey, Lisa. Racing from Belmont? Horsies! Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven. There's something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like...? Well, not like Bart. But there's gotta be a happy medium. Well, you know.... Bart was looking at that racy movie. And Lisa is losing a little respect for you. Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable. Unhook it? But I love cable! Then you should pay for it. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't so I'm not going to. Cable has become an evil presence in our home. Marge, I never put my foot down about anything. But I'm severely tempted to do it. No. I'm sorry, it's coming down. No. It's coming down. That's it! It's coming down! The cable stays. The foot has spoken. Lemonade? Please. Seen it. Cleans and straightens-- Seen it. Seen it. I was poor. Soccer. Seen it. Simpson. How did you get in? Your door wasn't locked well enough. Would you be interested in this stereo? A $500 value. You can have it for $40. Get out! Criminal! I'll go see a neighbor. He's not home! Even better. You sure about this? Doesn't look friendly. Can't be too careful. Thieves are everywhere. I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff. Come one, come all! Top Hat Theater is on the air! The most beautiful women! Just 50 cents! I'm your host, Bart Simpson! You must be at least 8 years old. And now The Top Hat Channel is proud to present Broadcast Nudes. Gross! Yet strangely compelling. It's a raid! What the--? I know you. Come back here! You promised me you wouldn't watch that trash. Go to your room! I wish I was an adult so I could break rules. Oh, great. I brought some imported generic beer. Thank you, Barney. How many people are coming? Just a select circle. Hello! I brought an assortment of jerkies. Did you swipe those from work? Certainly not. What are you implying? There is no love lost between these two warriors. We almost had a scuffle today at the weigh-in. You have a special motivation going into this bout. I want to dedicate this fight to my manager, Vinnie, who got me here... and then... ...passed away two weeks ago. Any response? I would also like to dedicate this fight to this manager. You can't! I can! You dedicate the fight to your manager! I want to tell you that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of nonviolent protest. Hi, Homer. I brought you-- Quick! It's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs. Will you get--? Hey, go protest outside, will you? Now! Hi. I brought you a mug. Thank you. I always wanted one of these. Oh! Mr. Burns! Hide the stuff I borrowed from work! Borrowed? Okay, that stuff I stole from work. Oh, okay. Come on! Take all this. Put it in the closet. Will you quit staring at me like that? Hello. We were in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by. Hello, Mr. Burns. Like to watch the fight? The fight! Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news. I brought some munchies. Smithers, the Cheetos. In but a few scant minutes, the anticipation-- Simpson? Yes. You have an illegal cable hookup. No. No, l-- It wasn't me. It was my wife's idea. Yeah! Hey, hey, hey. Settle down, fella. We were hoping we could watch the fight. Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest. Here's lemonade for your protest. Thanks, Mom. It isn't going very well. Don't give up. When you love somebody, you must have faith... that they will do the right thing. He learned how to fight in the projects of Capital City... and honed his skills while serving time for assault... in Springfield Prison. All right! A local boy! For 5 years, I was away from my kids and their mothers. The conditions were irrevocable. Assault. Manslaughter. Stealing cable TV! Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Shake hands. Keep it clean. Come on, boy! Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me. I've made a couple of important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable when the fight's over. Number two: I'm not very fond of any of you. Back to the fight. Get down! We may have saved your soul. Tatum is reeling! Yeah, at the worst possible time. Eight! Nine! Ten! This fight is history! It's done! A stunning knockout by a thunderous punch in the 12th round. Tatum is the new champion of the world! Everyone to my place for squishies and microwave burritos. Best fight ever and I missed it. We're really proud of you. What a donnybrook! Hogwash! I once watched Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo bare-knuckled for 113 rounds! Back then, if it was less than 50 rounds, we demanded our nickel back! Cable clippers. Here you go. Go for it, Dad. I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls. Atlanta Braves baseball. Joe Franklin! Third time's a charm.
#02x14 - Prinicapal Charming^Hey, Homer, did I wake you? I'm up! I'm up! I wanted to tell you about a new BBQ joint. Oh, BBQ! It's called Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit. I can still taste the sauce. And get this: -It's all-you-can-eat! This is like some beautiful dream! And one and two and three and reach... and five and six and-- Marge, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit. You promised you'd only have six servings of pork a week. I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do: We'll take the kids to your sisters' Saturday night. Then we'll eat till they kick us out! Saturday night? I'm not sure they're available. I'll take that bet. Hello, Marge. Saturday, we're going to Stanley Peterson's wedding. Although he's going at her like they're already married. Hey, alley cats. Save it for the honeymoon! Well, if you have other plans.... It's no problem. We'll leave before they toss the bouquet. "F." "L." No, I'm sorry. That's a "C, " isn't it? If that was a car, you'd be dead now. But driving is my livelihood. Take it like a man. Friends, relatives, work-related acquaintances... we are gathered here to join Stanley and Martha in holy matrimony. Martha, my dear, I remember the first day that I met you. Hello, Selma. Hello, Stanley. Is this seat taken? Yes! Hey, beat it! Had I not chosen that seat, Martha, my love... who knows what woman I might have ended up with? Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma? Will you ever get married? I don't know. Why? You know somebody? No. I'm sure you'd resent my pity, so I'll hope you're... one of the statistically small number of single 40-year-olds... who find their fair prince. Patty! Selma! We're home! I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever met me! Marge, I need to speak with you. Oh, and that sauce, Barney! I could have drunk a bowl of it! No, that's just my sister-in-law. I'll get right to it. I'm getting older and uglier. Please, Marge, help me find a man before it's too late. Well, I'll try. Do you remember when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame... so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin? Remember? Who could forget? Then you'll also remember you owe me a favor... to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire. But that was just an idle promise. Not to me! I want you to find Selma a husband. Find a husband?! Wait, which one's Selma? She's the one who likes Police Academy movies... and walking in the park on autumn days. I thought she was the one who didn't like to be touched. Patty chose celibacy but Selma simply had it thrust upon her. But Marge-- Homer, you will find her a man! Okay. And not just any man! He should be honest and caring and well-off and handsome! Why should she have a better husband than you? Sodium tetrasulfate is caustic and can remove your skin. Say when. When! What's this for? It's used in making rayons, film and as a preservative in fast foods. It's also a potent herbicide. What's a herbicide? It kills grass. Excellent. Must find man. Must find man. Must find man. Boy, a good man really is hard to find! According to my sources, you are simultaneously planning... to drop your pencils at 2: 15. Do so and you will be suspended. Who squealed? You can't get anything past him. He knows everything. Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats. He'll never get away with it. He just goes too far. One seafood burrito, Apu. The time has come for money to change hands. Oh, sorry. Say what they will about our cafeteria... I still think they're the best Tater Tots money can buy. Wait a minute... that smells like sodium tetrasulfate... bonding with chlorophyll. Sweet Lord, it is! Simpson! Surely you knew that by writing "Bart" in 40-foot letters... you would be caught. Maybe it was another Bart. There are none! The sheer contempt makes me wish I could use the board of education. Call your father. Is Homer there? Homer who? Homer Sexual. Wait one second, let me check. Homer Sexual! Come on, one of you guys has got to be Homer Sexual! Don't look at me! You little punk! If I get ahold of you... ...I'll rip your face off! You'll do what, young man? What? Wait. Who is this? The question is, who's this and where is Homer? Sorry, Principal Skinner. It's a bad connection, I think. For you. I think Bart's in trouble again. What now? The victim is the grass... on groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's okay with you... I'd like to punish Bart through backbreaking physical labor. Re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed. But enough about Bart. Tell me, are you married? Only to my job. But if you weren't, you'd tend to go for a girl? These pants come off at night just like everybody else's. Why all the questions? Oh, no reason. I was just wondering if... you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the things Bart has done! Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace. I'd be delighted! Excellent. Good evening and welcome to our home. I only hope we can put our differences aside for the next few hours. Just get inside already. He's here. What are you waiting for? Go shake your moneymaker. I'm too nervous. You do it. No, you do it. No, you do it. I had a discomforting thought on the way here. This dinner wouldn't be a plan to set me up with some... unmarried relation, would it? Because I can-- Be still, my foolish heart. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely... ...and available sister, Selma. Hey, tubs, I'm Patty! What? Patty. D'oh! Wrong one. So, Patty, tell me, tell me more about your trip to Egypt. Nothing more to tell, really. The Nile smells and the horseflies are huge. Marvelous. Just marvelous. Well, Selma hated Egypt too. A camel spit on her. They can be difficult. Patty... the Parents Advisory Board asked that I see Space Mutants Part V. Would you be interested in joining me? I don't-- She'd be delighted! I'll cancel. No. We already had plans. Your first date in 25 years is more important than playing cards. I tried to repel him, really. Pack of Lady Laramies. It could easily have been me. Very easily. Laramie Hi-Tars, hard pack. Here you go. Smoke them in good health. Any lottery tickets with that? No. All right, five. Stupid Principal Skinner. You gotta be kidding me. Save your strength, lad. There's a whole field for you to re-sod yet. Bart, you wouldn't know what sort of candy your aunt likes, would you? Cherry cordials, sir. Oh, very good. Now then, regarding your punishment, have you learned your lesson? Have I ever. The thought of doing wrong makes my stomach turn. Well, you're free to go. Willie, you can take it from here. Adiós. You haven't seen the last of Willie! I don't see why this is necessary. You don't want to show up for your big date looking like Yosemite Sam. How do I look? Achingly beautiful. Cherry cordials. I hope you like them. They're okay. Let's get this over with. Let's start with the Springfield Revolving Restaurant. Food tastes better when you're revolving. This evening has been disappointing. Indeed. Terrible. Hey! Can we get some service over here? I keep asking for water. Is everything all right? Little Jimmy Pearson. Class of '71, right? Principal Skinner. Get this woman a glass of water! And tuck in your shirt. Nearly 30 and still working as a busboy! Standardized testing never lies. I'm not surprised. She's always the lucky one. Two minutes younger. Skin like a china doll. Bosoms till Tuesday. Don't worry. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer? Oh, yes. Plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait. Don't be stupid! Sorry. Oh, come on, love, loosen up. I can't forget what happened to that poor dingo. What could've done it? It was probably just a wallaby. Now come on. Well, okay. Hello, Dolly. Oh, that was the worst movie I've ever seen. Not as bad as the service at the revolving restaurant. Isn't it nice we hate the same things? So, see me again tomorrow? That's my microwave cookery class. Then the day after that. Oh, gee, tae kwon do. The day after that? You're touching me. Kiss me, Patty. I don't have cooties. Thursday, I'm going food shopping. You can come if you like. Until then. I want every detail. Or is your tongue too tired? The movie was awful and he didn't get anything. Now good night. One kiss. But I don't want you bragging to your friends. Oh, I wish I could make a P.A. announcement to the whole world. Attention! Seymour Skinner is in love! That's cool. Skinner's gonna kill you! Skinner? He works for me now. Simpson? What is that there? Patty. I hate to pull you away from your exercise... but I wanted you to be first to know. I plan to ask your aunt to marry me. Your funeral. Homer, lighten up. You're making happy hour bitterly ironic. I gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma. I'm intrigued. What does she look like? Like my wife's ugly sister. Wheel her in, Homer. I'm not picky. The rule of thumb is 2 years' salary. I can't afford that! I'll take it. My sister's not going out with Barney Gumble! She's no prize pig herself, you know! Bart, come cheer up your Aunt Selma. Okay. What did you learn in school? Principal Skinner's gonna ask Patty to marry him. Thanks, kid. You made my day. But nothing! She's a heifer, plain and simple-- There's the little prom queen now. Can the sweet talk! You're right. It's time to end my girlish dreams... and grab hold of the next train out of the station. Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding! Oh, shut up. Why are you all dolled up? It takes a ripe piece of cheese to catch the mouse. It's time to give away my love like cheap wine. Take it to the hoop, Selma. Hey! Look what I brought! Schnapps? I'll take that. You seem preoccupied, my little pudding cup. My sister's on a date with a big, fat rummy. There's something up here that will pick up your spirits. "Marry me, Patty"? Jeezum Crow! Look at the size of that rock! The second most precious jewel here. Patty, will you marry me? I don't know. I mean-- Just say whatever's in your heart. It's not that I don't love you. You love me! Yes. Yes, but-- But? But I'm a twin, and as such I have a-- Special tie to your sister! Any man I could marry would have to-- Understand that you couldn't leave Selma. Yes. So I know you appreciate why you can never.... See you again? Exactly. It's kind of a Catch-22. Farewell, my Patty-cake. Good night, sweet principal. Oh, Springfield Elementary, I will have you back again! After all, tomorrow is another school day! And then when I got out of the service.... Well, the next few years are a blur. Where's Skinner? We decided we loved each other enough never to see each other again. I hope I can find a man like that. Are you throwing away happiness for me? Yes. Thanks. Now let's go get some pancakes. Listen, Barney.... She broke my heart, Moe. Don't worry, Barney. Time heals all wounds. What do you know? You're right. And look, a whole pitcher to myself. I told you you'd be back!
#02x15 - Oh Brother, Where Arth Thou?^Let's move on to new business. Have you taken care of McBain? Don't worry, Senator Mendoza. By now our dear friend has met with a... shall we say, unfortunate accident? Great. With McBain out of the way, nothing can stop us! Any more new business? Only your death! McBain! McBain! Meeting adjourned. $2.50 for this? What a gyp! You broke up that meeting. Now I'm thinking about holding another meeting in bed. Oh, McBain! I want to see the manager! The screen's small! The floor's sticky! The subplot felt tacked on. We demand a refund! It's not our policy. I'll policy you! Don't have a heart attack, old dude. Don't you tell me... what to do, you... young whipper... snapper! Thanks for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality... ...at least in this country. Amen. Very nicely said. Bart ate during the blessing! You opened your eyes. Eating is worse. Is not! Is too! Is not! One more word and Bart gets no cartoons... and Lisa can't go to college! Dad! Not one word! Knock it off. We didn't talk. Not a word. No panto-ma-mine, either. Telephone, Homer. It's the hospital. The hospital? Hello? Oh, my God! I'm happy to say that he only had a mild arrhythmia. Mild! There wasn't anything mild about it! Now get back to the pharmacy, you quack! With that feisty attitude, you'll bury us all, Grampa Simpson. Pull your chair closer, my son. What is it, Dad? Not that close! Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die someday. Oh, Dad! You and your imagination. There's something I think you should know. You have a half-brother. A half-brother? It all happened while I was courting your mother. I was checking out the skirts at the carnival when I first saw her. Hey, handsome, wanna dunk the clown? She did things your mother would never do. Like have s*x for money. A year later, the carnival came back... and she had a little surprise for me. We left the baby at the Shelbyville orphanage, and I never saw him again. A year later, I married your mother and we had you. I want Homer to grow up respecting his father. He must never know about that carnival incident. Promise you won't tell. I promise. Forget what I just told you. Why are you blubbering? This makes me feel special. Since I'm the one you kept, it means you really love me. Interesting theory. I'm going to find my brother. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him! Yeah, right. Good luck. A long-Iost half-brother. How Dickensian! Know where this b*st*rd lives? His parents aren't married. It's the correct word, isn't it? He's got us there. b*st*rd! b*st*rd! b*st*rd! Bart! Bart! b*st*rd! 2-1 -4-8, this is it. Excuse me, is this an orphanage? You're a little late. They tore that down 30 years ago. Thirty years! I'll never find him! I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh, brother, where art thou? Easy. They moved across the street. Sorry. I know how you feel. I've spent years searching for my long-Iost twin brother-- Yeah, but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name? Our records state the Powells adopted him and named him Herbert. Herbert Powell, great! Where can I find him? Sorry, I'm not allowed to say. Please! This is my life we're talking about here! I do sympathize with your situation, Mr. Simpson. Your brother could be anywhere, even Detroit. I know he could be anywhere! Narrow it down, please! If you ask me... the city of brotherly love isn't Philadelphia, it's Detroit. Changing the subject makes you a worthless excuse for a human being-- Read between the lines, you fool! I get it! Here's 20 bucks. Now, will you tell me where my brother lives? I don't-- Take it and tell me! He lives in Detroit. Fine. Thank you. Let's see, Powell.... "Pomerantz." "Poole." "Popkin." "Potter." "Quigley." "Quimby." "Randolph." Oops, too far. Here it is, "Powell"! Any luck? No. I called all three Herbert Powells, nothing. Well, you want to try that H. Powell? "H"! Of course! That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but-- Is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan? By any chance does the "H" stand for Herbert? The "H" stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted? From the Shelbyville Orphanage? How did you know? Because I'm your baby brother, Homer! Hello? Hello? Stupid phone! Knock it off! I'm here! I was silent due to emotion. Sorry. We need to meet. Grab a plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out-- I'll tell you what, why don't you come here? Are we there yet? Just a little further. We there yet? Just a little further! If you don't behave we'll turn around and go home. But, Marge, I want to see my brother! Homer, it's an empty threat. Did you know you were going--? Sorry, sir, I didn't know it was you. That's okay. Carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge? What are you doing here? What does it look like? We're losing to the Japanese. Why? Unfair trade practices? Mushy one-worlders in Washington? Some gypsy curse? I'm tired of excuses! Why did I hire Harvard idiots? You went there. But Mommy and Daddy didn't pay my way! I had to work, washing your dishes and toilets! I remember you. What's the name for our new car? You'll love this. The Persephone! Persephone? What the hell kind of name is that? She was the Greek goddess of spring and rebirth. She was carried off to Hades where she ate six pomegranate s-- People don't want cars named after hungry, old, Greek broads! They want names like Mustang and Cheetah, vicious animal names. The problem is, you've forgotten your roots! What are your roots? I guess they extend to when the Angles met the Saxons. When white met bread. What are your roots? What can they teach us? I have no roots. All I know is that... I'm just a lonely guy. What was he so upset about? Good Lord. Marge, this can't be the right address. Hello, in there. Homer? Herb? You look just like-- Except you got a little more-- And a little less-- God, I feel so-- Herbert! Homer! Welcome to my home, brother. Holy moly! The b*st*rd's rich! Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is my wife, Marge. You old dog, she's gorgeous! Thank you. Our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Hello, sir. Hello. All born in wedlock? Yes, but Bart was a close call. Lisa, are you the hell-raiser your father told me about? No, I can assure you I'm not. I'm the hell-raiser. Do you want to hold the baby? I don't know how. Oh, what's to know? Just dive in. Catch! God, that new-baby smell. Homer, you're the richest man I know. I feel the same about you. I want you to make yourselves at home. Any time you're hungry, day or night, Cook will make you anything you want. Even pork chops? Absolutely. We've a tennis court-- If I want pork chops in the middle of the night, he'll fry them up? Sure. That's what he's paid for. If you need towels-- Wait! Let me see if I got this right. It's Christmas day, 4:00 a.m... ...there's a rumble in my belly-- Homer! You sure love pork chops! He sure does, Uncle Herb. "Uncle Herb" sounds so formal. Do you think you could call me "Unky Herb"? No problemo, Unky Herb. He's adorable. My nephew's adorable. Marco! Polo. Will you kids shut up? So, Marge, a little about yourself. I met Homer in high school. We married and had three beautiful children. Wow, we have so much catching up to do. I just told you pretty much everything. Watch me dive! Okay, we're watching! I hope we're not spoiling them. You weren't watching! You didn't see! A millionaire! I kept the wrong one. I'll come as soon as I can leave here. In the meantime, please don't do anything stupid. Can I spit over the side? I love this kid. Hawk your brains out. Got him! Cook? Sorry to bother you, but I got a hankering for-- That's right! With applesauce. Pick out any one you want. You sure you want to give me a car? You know what they cost me? There's maybe $40 worth of steel in them. Okay, I'd like a big one then. We don't have a big one. Why not? Americans don't want big cars. Give me one with lots of pep. Our cars don't have pep. Why not? Americans want good mileage. Tell the nice man what country you come from. America. You hear that, morons? This is why we're getting killed! Instead of listening, you're telling people what they want. I need your help. You do? Yeah. I want you to help me design a car. A car for all the Homer Simpsons out there. I want to pay you $200,000 a year! And I want to let you! Homer, meet my team of engineers. They're gonna build your car. Hi, team. This project is our top priority. I don't want to see anything till it's finished. But, sir-- Direct all your questions to Mr. Simpson... the man with the vision. He'll bust this company out of its rut. He'll change American transportation forever! So, what kind of car would you like? I don't know. Whatever you kids want to do today, tell me. Oh, dear. I want a pony ride. I want a boat ride. Pony ride! Boat ride! Pony ride! Ahoy, mateys! Kids are so easy to please. I hope we're not spoiling them. What's that? The onboard computer. All right. What's that? Your brother told you to help us. Yeah, he did. Why don't you get us some coffee? Okay. Batting ninth, Unky Herb! Oh, boy. How's your car coming? We're putting in an onboard something and rack-and-peanut steering.... Homer, you didn't ask for rack-and-pinion steering, did you? I think I did. How could you ask for it? You don't know what it is. May I be excused? No. You know why I gave you this job? You think I'm a genius? No, not that. You think I'm dynamic? I don't think so. You think I work well with others? No. It's because you're an average schmo. All you need is self-confidence. Unky Herb, I don't know-- Listen to me. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself: "If nothing else, I'm sure of this!" Understand? Sort of. Homer! What? Answer with self-confidence. Sort of! Now go get them! I want a place in this car to put my drink! Sir, the car has a beverage holder. Hello, Einstein! I said a place to put my drink. The Super Slakers they sell at K wik-E-Marts are this big! Very big beverage holder. I'm not done! The little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car. Little ball. Some things are so snazzy they never go out of style. Tail fins... ...and bubble domes.... I gotta call the boss. Hello. Well, you know what? I'm glad you're nervous... because that means we're on the right track. All right! This is what you're gonna do. Hang up and call me back. Say the exact opposite of everything you just said. Kids, come here. What is it? Hear what the guys think of your dad. Hello. Homer Simpson is a brilliant man... with lots of well-thought-out, practical ideas. He's ensuring the financial security of this company. Oh, yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach. Our dad's the greatest! Homer, I'm impressed! Pretty good, huh? Put a horn here, here and here. I can't find it when I'm mad. And they should play "La Cucaracha." Can do. Sometimes the kids are in the back hollering. There must be something we can do about that. A built-in video game? You're fired! What are we paying you for? A separate soundproof dome for the kids? With restraints and muzzles. Bull's-eye! And when I gun the motor... I want people to think the world is coming to an end! The mouse is named ltchy and the cat is Scratchy. They hate each other. They express it. Good. To think I wasted my life in boardrooms and meetings. I could have been watching cartoons! This old fool's wasted his life. Do you miss the Antarctic? Now this is spoiling them. No. Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed stockholders... members of the press, Your Holiness. Tonight we are going to witness automotive history. Whatever Homer wants... All my life, I've looked for a car that feels right. ...Homer gets Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft like a Nerf ball. Now I've found it. Presenting the car designed for the average man... the Homer! Questions? What does this monstrosity cost? Jerry, what's the sticker price? $82,000! This monstrosity costs $82,000? What have I done? I mean, the zoo was fun... but I'm ruined! Bye, Unky Herb. Goodbye, Herb. Because of me, you lost your business, your home and all your possessions. Maybe you'd have been better off if I'd never come into your life. Maybe I'd have been better off? Maybe? You sponge-head, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother! Maybe he said that to make conversation. His life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a Simpson. I'm here! Where's that millionaire chip off the old block I call sonny? Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home. I knew you'd blow it! Dad? What is it, boy? I thought your car was cool. Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that.
#02x16 - Bart's Dog Gets an F^No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop! Not the sports section! Stupid dog! No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food! Time to get up, Lisa. It's a school day. Lisa, you don't look well. I'll make it, Mom. Just tape my lunch box to my hand. My, you're burning up. And your cheeks are so swollen. I think you have the mumps. I'll call Dr. Hibbert. The dog is hungry. Well, then, feed him. Yes, master. You're my best friend. You're my best friend. Hello, Dr. Hibbert? Not that I'm angry, but how did you get my home number? I see. Quite ingenious. I think Lisa has the mumps. Well, Mrs. Simpson... I'd like to rely on your diagnosis, but it'd be derelict of me to do so. Let me check my schedule. 2:00 is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. No way, she's faking. If Lisa stays home, I stay home. lf Bart stays home, I go to school. Fine, then-- Wait. If Lisa goes to school, I go. But if she stays, I stay, so... ...Lisa goes to school.... Don't confuse him. Have a nice day at school. Get my homework. Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox. Don't waste the mumps. Bart-dude! Hey, Otto-man! Yo, hairy bro. Go home, boy. Go home. Wandering mongrel. Get out of my mom-and-pop operation. Hello? This is Sylvia Winfield. Your canine is in my pool again. I'm calling the dog warden. Are you? You go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old axe... because my dog is tied up! There's only one family... on Earth inconsiderate enough to let that monster roam free! Are you going deaf, or are you just stupid? I'll explain one more time, and then I'm going to hang up on you. It is not my dog! I tied my dog outside myself! I am looking at him right-- Well, how-doodlie-do. Getting some exercise? Good for you. Look at this rascal. He's a wet boy, isn't he? You're a water monster. Well, well, "Mr. Universe" takes a walk. "Mr. Universe, " I wish. Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and-- Assassins! You bet. They've got Velcro, a water pump, built-in odometer, and vanity plates. How much? Well, they're not giving them away. But you've got to spoil yourself. Yeah. My heart rate's dropping. Better skedaddle-y-do. Discoloration of the glands. Oh, dear. Swelling of the parotids. I knew it. Lisa has the mumps. You'll be missing a week of school. Oh, no. I don't want to fall behind my class. Such responsibility. What's your favorite subject? Arithmetic. Arithmetic. Before you know it, you'll be back among your polygons... and your Euclidian algorithms. You get rest and have a lollipop. Hello? Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? The mumps? Oh, the kissing disease. My little girl is growing up. Yuck. Quit it, Dad. So, what does my little girl want? What? Let me write this down. Copies of... Teen Dream, Teen Scream... and Teen Steam magazine? Well, okay, you're the sickie. Goodbye, Lisa. Lenny, I need to leave. Cover for me. Hey, sure thing, Homer. Well, Lisa, here it is. The Bouvier family quilt. Wow, neat. It smells historic. For five generations, women in our family have added to it. Now it's your turn. I don't know how. You do, you just don't know it. The memory of a million drop stitches flows in your veins. Very impressive. You try it. You just need to develop a callous. You see? Now that's a sewing finger, honey. Oh, man, $2.00? I'll take these three. They're for my daughter. Sure. Wise guy. Assassins! Oh, 125 bucks! Sometimes you've gotta spoil yourself. But I can't-- Simpson! I order you to buy those shoes! You're the boss! This one's mine. "Keep On Truckin' "? What does that mean? I didn't know then. I don't know now. Here's your stupid homework. Phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? Do your own homework, Bart! Your magazines. How many of these guys are Corey? Eight. Thanks, Dad. Assassins! Yep. Read 'em and weep. Those are very elaborate. They better be, for $125. $125! Bart! We agreed to consult before major purchases. You bought those smoke alarms, and we haven't had a single fire. A manhunt, or "woman-hunt", is on-- You know, yours is the only show I'll do. As an actor, my eyes need to look their whitest-- It's a penalty kick-- Shoelace.... No! There seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here. School's your answer to everything.... This one looks very reputable. Lovely. Have a toffee. Such a neat dog. Have at them. Well done. If I could borrow... ..."Satan's Little Helper." Santa's Little Helper. Ladies and gentlemen. You already know that with a little love... any puppy will grow up to be a bundle of joy. Nonsense taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits! I'll tell you the most important words you'll ever hear... choke chain. Raise a dog the same as a child, with simple, authoritative commands. Lay down! Followed by immediate correction. How can we tell we're doing it right? The dog's eyes will cross, and his tongue will protrude slightly. Is my dog dead, ma'am? You don't know how often I'm asked that. They are always breathing. Jack, I think the baby might be yours. I'm sure it is. But prove it. You treat me like garbage. Because that's the way you love it, baby. Gee, is it always this good? I don't know. I just dip in and out. I'm only watching because Brandy knows the body is hidden in the boathouse. That dog! Bad dog! Don't worry, Snowball. Mom, what will we do if the dog doesn't learn anything? I don't know. Father! I thought you were dead. I was! There are two ways for a dog to relieve himself. One, like a friend. The other, like a hose without a fireman. Which way do you think that was? Like a hose, you wrinkled queen. I decided I don't want the shoes. What happened here? My dog was bringing me my shoes, and they fell apart in his mouth. Our warranty doesn't cover fire, theft or acts of dog. Big cookie. Aloha. Aloha. Want a free sample? The price is right. Macamademia nuts. If you'd like to buy, they're $1. So that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win. Property... of Homer J. Simpson. Hands off! Mom, I've finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life. On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher. He taught that the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty. On the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is a fire that comes out your mouth. So you better stick an instrument in front of it. And look. I want you to see what your sick little girl did. My quilt! Six generations, ruined! Now, Marge, honey... come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt. But you can't get too attached to-- My cookie! This is not happening! We're having a family meeting! We never did this before. We never had a family member we can give away. What are you saying? I'm saying-- No! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair, rip my clothes! I've suffered at the paws of this dog... but when I look into his vacant eyes, I can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me. No, I'm afraid I agree with your father. You do? Please. It's not just the quilt. He's nice, but he chews everything. He's not even housebroken. We've spent money on training, with no improvement. All right. If he studies hard, passes finals, and becomes a perfect dog... ...can we keep him? No! Dad! Dad! This is our pet. We can question his disposition, but we can't question his heart. Is the way to solve a problem with something you love to throw it away? If they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner. All right. If he passes, we can keep him. All right! See, boy? It's not so hard. Roll over. Roll over. Like this. Congratulations, you've earned a toffee. Thank you. You moldy old maid. Can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test? No, we have to commit to it. Now take this down: Free to loving home, world's smartest dog. Says "I love you" on command. Type. Now, sit! I said, sit! Take a walk. Sniff that other dog's butt. See? He does exactly what I say. We'd never give him away, but we're moving, and dogs are forbidden. Hear what? Oh, sure. Come here, boy! Put that prowler down and come here! Come on! Say "I love you" for the nice man. Good dog! Isn't that amazing? See you soon. You think your dogs know the "stay" command. Let's see if they can stay away from this beef Wellington. Now, stay. Stay, boy! Stay! Stay! He'd be happy at my farm. People think only mules can pull carts. Impatient people think that, patient people know better. You can take him tomorrow. Miss Winthrop, I was thinking. Oh, dear. Since you get paid either way... would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass? I see. Rubber stamp, thank you, next in line. Is that it? Yeah. Heavens to murgatroid. Perhaps I cling to the old ways like a well-chewed shoe... as the traditions I was weaned on are put to sleep, one by one. But my time has not passed yet! We do not need another college graduate who doesn't know how to sit! He'll sit! Come on, boy. Sit! Pull the chain! Correct the dog! I don't want to strangle my dog. Pull the bloody chain, boy! I'm sorry. You can't help being dumb. What are you doing? Sewing a new quilt. It's one thing to be a link in a chain. It's another to start one. This patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt. Well, you certainly captured the moment. Come on, boy. Sit! Sit! Sit! Oh, man. Bart, he's not gonna learn it now. Don't spend your last hours together tormenting him. Have some fun. Frolic with him. Go get it, boy! I'm gonna miss you, boy. I thought we'd be pals forever. But we have to say goodbye because you don't understand a word I say. If you knew how to learn-- Sit. Wait a minute, you did it! Lay down. Shake hands. Stay! Speak! All right! Good boy! Roll over. You son of a bitch! Good show! All right!
#02x17 - Old Money^Next time we'll do something more fun. Oh, what could be more fun than today's trip to the liquor store? Thanks for the jerky! Say goodbye. Bye. Good-- Grampa smells like that trunk with the wet bottom. He smells like a photo lab. Stop it! Grampa smells like an old man, which is like a hospital hallway. That's terrible. We should teach them to value the elderly. We'll be old someday. My God, you're right! You kids won't put me in a home? Well.... What'll we do? I think we better set an example. Absolutely! Our Sundays should be a pleasure. Where's a fun place we can take Grampa? To the pony ride! No. Boring. He can't sit. I enjoy the glass blower at Old Springfield. He saw that. Big yawner. The Museum of Barnyard Oddities! No, Bart! No! That's gross. I got it! The Mystery Spot! It's just a dumb mud puddle. Discount Lion Safari! Like I'm gonna ruin $600 teeth... on 40 cents' worth of beef. These aren't my pills! Now, Mr. Simmons. Don't make me call Nurse Bronski. It's Simpson, and these aren't my pills. Excuse me. My name is Simmons. I have the wrong pills. I get two red for my back, a yellow one for my arrhythmia... and two of the bluest eyes I've ever seen in my life. These must be.... I have your.... They must have.... Look at us. We're staring like a couple of stupid punk teenagers. Oh, I wasn't staring, it's, uh, my lazy eye. I'm Beatrice Simmons. My friends call me Bea. Well, I'm Abraham J. Simpson. Care to tip the wrist with me? I would be delighted. So, tell me about yourself. Widower, one son, one working kidney. And you? Widowed, bad hip, liver disorder. You left something out: Ravishing! What are you doing tonight? Sitting alone in my room. If you've got plans already-- No! What were you saying? Nothing. Abe. You were going to say something. I was wondering if you and l, you know... might go to the same place. You'd think this would get easier! I'd love to. Okay, now where's that pomade? Ah! "Never fly solo again." Aw, damn! Out of pomade. Oh, well. Oh, hello, young lady. Is your grandmother home? Oh, Abe. I'd better keep my good eye on you. Damn straight. Herman, a special lady is having her birthday tomorrow. The battleship New Jersey. You idiot! My girlfriend, Bea. Since this is the only store I know-- Nothing says "I love you" better than a military antique. Take a look at the bayonet case. Hey, what's that? That was Napoleon's hat. It doesn't look it. Not the famous one. He wore it for a week in 1796. Before he beat the Sardinians. How much? $400. I'll give you $5. Not an offer you should make to a man with a gun. Try Grandma's World. Activewear, I need a price check on a wool shawl. Dad! It's Sunday. You know what that means. Go away! Oh, come on, Dad. I promise we'll have fun. We're gonna see lions. I can't. It's my girlfriend Bea's birthday. Oh, you have a girlfriend. Well, happy birthday, Bea. She can come with us. There's room for all your friends. She's not invisible, you idiot! It's her birthday tonight. Right. Stop kicking the seat! I'm kicking it! You want to know where we're going? No. Discount Lion Safari! Damn these childproof doors! Hello. That'll be 18.50, Bwana. "Do not feed or allow animals in car. Do not make eye contact." Are we in Africa yet? This place sucks. The animals are sleeping. Let 'em sleep on their own time! Are you sure this is the way? The road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy. What a wingding. This is much better than my girlfriend's party. Bart, get out and push. Yeah, Bart, get out and push. No way! Okay, we've seen a lion. Can we go now? Oh, Bea! Mr. Simpson, I presume. I got a date with an angel. You don't know how right you are. What? I'm sorry to tell you this, but... ...Bea passed away last night. Oh, no. The doc said her left ventricle burst. No, Jasper. They may say she died of a burst ventricle... but I know she died of a broken heart. I can tell she really cared. She didn't make me a pallbearer. I can't tell you how sorry I am. Is someone talking? I didn't hear anything. Oh, no! Dad's lost his hearing! No, you idiot! I'm ignoring you! You made me miss the last moments of Bea's life. I'll never speak to you again! I have no son! Oh, Bea. It was a beautiful service. Who are you? Lionel Hutz, attorney. I'm the executor of the estate. Bea was wealthy and-- Surprise, surprise! She left it all to you. Really? There is one catch. You must spend one night in a haunted house. Just kidding. Here's a check for $106,000... "To enjoy as you see fit." Oh, I'm touched. $106,000! Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, I do wills. Here's a pen with my phone number on it. It looks like a cigar. Isn't that neat? Hello, Homer? Dad's on the phone! Oh, Dad, I knew you'd forgive me. I haven't forgiven you! I just inherited $106,000... and I just had to tell you that you're not getting one thin dime! Mr. Simpson? What is it? I couldn't help hearing about your money. Let me assure you that here, money does make a difference. There are rubdowns, and then there are rubdowns. Listen, you bloodsucker! Does it ever occur to you that old folks should be treated like humans... ...whether they have money or not? Yes, but it passes. Oh, you lousy son of a.... I'll take it! Big spender, why the change? Bea told me to enjoy my moola and I'm going to, dagnab it! Where to? Take me someplace fun! You're the boss. Next stop, Funsville. I miss Bea. I miss you too. Oh, calm down. I'm not here to scare you. I'm haunting a family in Texas. Oh, well, I'm glad you're keeping busy. I want to know why my money isn't bringing you happiness. Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out for the highlife. If you're not happy, why don't you spread it around? Make other people as happy as you made me. Oh, thanks, Bea. I will! And your son misses you. Oh, I miss him too, the big fat dickens. Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you, what was death like? Not as scary as this! I miss my daddy. This thing has had you moping around for days. I think it's time for you to talk to someone. You've reached Dr. Monroe's Anxiety Line. If you have a sullen teenager, press 1. For spousal problems, press 2 now. If you have trouble-- Grampa! Dad! Sonny-boy! Is there room at your table for an old man? Well, sure! We'll have to move a chair in, but it's no problem. Bart! Choose your corncob. En garde! Challenge accepted! All my precious sacks of gold... couldn't buy me the joys of a family meal. Pass the bug juice. Wait your turn! I have an announcement. I've decided to give Bea's money away... to people who need it. I'm gonna let them come to me and plead their case and then I'll decide. That's the noblest thought ever expressed at this table. Give it to us. Bart! Forgive him. He's just a stupid little kid... who says the first thing in his head. You know, he is wise. You don't want it. I do. You ain't getting it! Not since my marriage to the weather lady... has this town been so consumed with rumor and innuendo. Here's why: Today, one Abraham "Grampa" Simpson announced... that he'll give away over $100,000 to the person he finds most deserving. Is Grampa Simpson a saint, a rich nut, or both? Time will tell. Kent Brockman, on line for an old man's money. You see, Gramps, I wanna customize the bus. Chop the top, jack it up, put on wheels... psychedelic paint job from hell. Jam the kids to school! Here's a rendering. Note the cobra wrapped around the naked chick. Next! Grampa? I can call you Grampa, can't I? Go ahead. I need that money. Please--! Wait! You're the guy who owns the nuclear power plant. Ownership is divided-- What are you doing? I dread the day when $100,000 isn't worth groveling for. Get out of here! You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man. Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy I think was an explorer left this in the bar. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to a house. To find out, we'll need money, provisions and a diving bell. It's pretty stupid, but so far you're the front-runner. It's an isolation chamber. A subject pulls levers to get heat and food. The floor can become electrified and water falls on the subject. I call it the Monroe box. Well, it sounds interesting. How much will it cost? It's already built! I need the money to buy a baby to raise in the box. To prove what? The subject should be maladjusted and harbor resentment towards me. Interesting.... I want a tear gas pen, a blowgun with paralyzer darts-- Oh, no! Nunchucks. Nunchucks? What are those? Radioactive Man number 27. And I want that baseball card where the guy's flipping the bird. I've seen that one. And a monkey. What the hell is that? Why, it's a death ray, my good man. Behold. Hey, feels warm. Kind of nice. Well, it's just the prototype. With funding, this baby could destroy an area the size of New York. I wanna help people, not kill them! Oh. The ray only has evil applications. My wife'll be happy. She's hated this death ray from day one. Oh, Lisa, what makes you think you deserve all that money? I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are in the slums. They're children who need books and families who can't make ends meet. But you can buy me a pony. You're right! I'll name her Princess. No, you're right about the poor souls who need a helping hand. I need to take a walk. Oh, dear. Oh! I'm exhausted. Poor baby, been lifting your wallet? No! I've decided to give my money away... to truly needy causes! But $100,000 just isn't enough. I need more. Why don't you go on the gambling junket? You could double your money. Tempting. They got a 99-cent shrimp cocktail. You've sold me! Trying to get us killed? It's too hot, maniac! Turn on the air already! Hey, mellow out, old dudes, or I'll jam this baby into a river! I'm looking for Abe Simpson. It's important. I don't care about his money, I love him! We get that a lot. He left with the casino junket. Casino! Come on, everybody! Hello, I'm Plato. Please partake of keno, craps and the town's loosest slots. My philosophy is: Enjoy! Change, please. Burger, onion rings, shake! And for God's sake, hurry! $5000 on-- What century is this? The 20th. Put it on 20. Excuse me. Have you seen an old man? He looks like me only wrinkled. Have you seen--? Dad! No! 20 black. Holy moly, you're winning! You're cramping me. Quit while you're ahead, understand? You gotta leave! I have to get enough for everybody. But you could lose everything! Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best. "If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn..." ...and lose, and start again at your beginnings... and never breathe a word about your loss... yours is the earth and everything that's in it... "...and, which is more, you'll be a man, my son." You'll be a bonehead! Put it all on 41. I've got a feeling. The wheel only goes to 36. Put it all on 36. I've got a feeling. Dad, no! Give me that money! Come on! Stop it! Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! 36! No more bets. Son, if this lands on 36, I'll.... Double zero. Son! You saved me from losing all my money. For the first time, I'm glad I had children. So have you figured out who gets the money? Yes, Homer, I have. Come on in. Dignity's on me, friends.
#02x18 - Brush With Greatness^
#02x19 - ^Live from Mt. Splashmore, the county's funnest water park... ...it's The Krusty the Clown Show! Hey, kids! You know, today's the last day of our special week... on location at fabulous Mt. Splashmore. I just want to say these people have been super to me and Sideshow Mel. The food, the grog.... They threw a brunch with fresh fruit and the most delicious melon. The thing I'll miss most... is those special Mt. Splashmore water slides, God bless them. So fun. So many memories. Excuse me. It has been a great week, hasn't it, Lis? Come out and pack this place, just to show them how grateful I am. I told them you would. Don't make me a liar! Okay, kids! It's time to.... I want to go to Mt. Splashmore Take me, take me Take me now Now now now Now now Mt. Splashmore Take me there right now This is a rather shameless promotion. Worked on me. Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? No. Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? No! Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? No! Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? No! Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? No! If I take you, will you two shut up? Yeah! Of course! Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore? Yes! Come on, Homer! Get the lead out! Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination. Kids, I'm moving the seat back. It is back. Everybody, stick together. We don't want to get separ-- D'oh! Challenge the raging waters of death! Discover what water's really made of! H-2-Whoa! Whoa! All right! No line! Ay caramba! Okay. Turn on the waterworks, babe. Mommy! I want my mommy! Step aside. Spread out. Lost kid coming through. Pardon me. Moving to the front. Nice work, babe. No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end. The hell with this! Slide inspector coming through! Move to the right. Move! I'm here for your safety. God bless that man! Bitchen. What? Come on, you stupid tube! There's a jam in Delta sector. Too big to be human. Send kids to dislodge it. Roger. Can't breathe. Too many children. Boo! Boo! Witnesses estimate the man's weight at 400 to 500 pounds. On the lighter side of news, and I use the term loosely.... It's safe! This was an isolated incident! I understand, Krusty. Isn't that what you said before the recall of Krusty-Brand Mayonnaise? That question is out of bounds. Interview's over! All right, family. I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight? Well, am I? Forgive us, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response. Four hundred thirty seven-- Fifty-five? My God! Three hundred and-- A hundred and fifty? Oh, my God! Two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big, fat pig! Now, Homer, you do have big bones. Marge, no one gains 30 pounds of bone! I'm going on a diet! From now on... there'll be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty... no pizza too laden with delicious toppings... to prevent me from reaching my ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again! D'oh! Shut up! This old attic's kind of spooky, isn't it? I said, isn't it? Don't ever do that again! Okay. Get away from that and find my athletic equipment! Homer, I found your weights. Oh, the Glutimus Maximizer. Who's the mop-top with the schnoz? That's Ringo Starr. What is this? Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute. What? Hey! What the--? Marge! Don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl. The Beatles were very popular. A likely story. Why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night? Homer, we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you. Wait, I've been setting my drinks on these things! They're only 35 calories apiece. Hello? Hello! Hello, taste? Where are you? Put something on top, for flavor. Now you're talking! These paintings are good. I know how fragile young talent is. Tell me how your gift was squashed. Well.... Another one of that bongo beater! Mr. Schindler-- One might've used this canvas to paint a masterpiece. Instead, you've soiled it forever. Now this is art! Thanks, Mr. Schindler. I can't believe you gave up because of one small-minded art teacher. I sent the portrait to the only man whose opinion I could trust. And what was Ringo's response? I never got any. I never painted again. Take a class at community college. What do you think, Homer? Do I have to do anything? No. Great! Fine! Go nuts! Only 35 calories. Hello, Mrs. Homer! Apu, why are you here? I enrolled in Screenwriting. I yearn to tell the story of a young Hindu... pushed too far by Quik-E-Mart bandits: -It's Hands off My Jerky, Turkey. Clever title. Thanks. My brother thought of it. Next up. My mother would like to enroll in Painting from Life 2B. Not so fast there. No one can enroll until Mr. Lombardo approves their portfolio. Lisa, this was a bad idea. Mom.... Very good. Fabulous. Even better! You have real talent. You think so? My art teacher hated them. What? The man was a fool! I admire the force of his conviction. I'm in the class? There couldn't be a class without you. If you'll excuse me, nature calls. Marvelous! The Heavy Hands only work if you move. I can't. Oh, really? Now, using the Lombardo method... you learn to see everyday objects as simple geometrical shapes. Here, we see how two circles, various trapezoids, ellipses... and yes, even a rhombus... can create an adorable bunny rabbit. It's just that easy! Lincoln, I've been thinking What have you been drinking? Is it water? Is it wine? Oh, my gosh, it's turpentine Bravo! Walk away. Now it belongs to the ages. Not another stroke! Oh, one more. That's it! Perfect! Indeed. You find the inner beauty of your subject. Thank you, professor. You're welcome. Marge, walk with me. They want me to submit a painting from my class... to the art exhibition next week. I've decided to choose your Bald Adonis. Really? I wish every teacher was like you. Marge, please. I don't take praise very well! Oh! Another triumph! I can't believe it! Yeah, Mom! I'm a work of art! Last Supper, eat your heart out. Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, housepainter? Throw this on the dung heap! I quit. Well, I guess that's artistic temperament. Sir, the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum... ...is six days away. Damnation! This is as half-baked as your idea about me having children. Find me an artist. You've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community. The only one left is Mrs. Simpson. Who? She's the wife of an employee. She'll be easily intimidated. Excellent! Once again, the wheel has turned... and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet bosom. Somebody up there likes me. Down here too. Shut up! D'oh! D'oh! Two-forty-nine! Yeah! Marge! Marge, look at me! My clothes are hanging off me. That's wonderful! Right, kids? I told you to show support. Way to go, Dad! You look marvelous! Oh, what a family. What gives? These donuts are piling up. Homer Simpson went on a diet. Oh, my God! And I just bought a boat! Don't people answer the door? Allow me. Open up! Open up! Mr. Burns! Would you like to come in? He'd like to commission a portrait. Have you painted the rich? No, just Ringo Starr. Ring Go? He was the drummer for the Beatles. Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. This commission and all of its glory can be yours... but you must answer one question. Shoot. Can you make me beautiful? That won't be a problem. I'm no matinee idol. Maybe not, but I have the gift of seeing inner beauty. Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me. At last, the world will see you as I always have. Yes. Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers. Now, you, paint! Honey, I'm home! There's an original sentiment. Take it outside. I'm male-modeling. I'm painting his portrait. Isn't that wonderful? My work and my home life, come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you? He thinks he's handsome. You've gotta make him look handsome! Don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty. What were you like as a boy? Did you have a dog that you loved? Something's on my leg! Get it off! Mr. Burns, she's just a baby! All right, all right. Who took the funny pages? So Ziggy goes to the repair shop. There's a sign reading "Out of Order." Oh, Ziggy, will you ever win? Oh, my. Excuse me! I'm changing for a meeting! I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. Did he have spots all over his body? I heard that! Should I leave too, sir? Of course not, Smithers. You're like a doctor. Smithers! I want my tea! Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around? Actually, I value every second. I squeeze his juice each morning. I tuck him in at night. He's not just my boss. He's my best friend. Too hot! Right. It's scalding me as we speak. "Dear Sally, in response to your letter of Dec. 12, 1966..." ...me favorite color's blue, and me real name's Richard. Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Love, Ringo. "PS: Forgive the late reply." Mr. Starr, tea. Set it over there. If you'll forgive me, your devotion to your fans is remarkable. They took the time to write me. Even if it takes 20 more years, I'm going to answer every one of them. Hello! What's this? From Springfield, U.S.A. Gear! Cease that infernal tootling! I was practicing. It's hard to find your beauty if you're shouting at a little girl. We've only got two days left. Shut up and paint! Okay, scale. We don't like each other... but I've been good so treat me right! All right! Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and feeling fine I'm using the original notches! That's wonderful, Homer! I'm-- Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? You're the fattest thing I've ever seen... and I've been on safari. If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator. I've had enough of your posing! I can finish the portrait myself. Another day and I would've needed a Valium. Thank you for your hospitality. See you at the unveiling. What are you doing? Give me that! He's right. What's the use? Don't listen to him! He's a mean little SOB. Oh, Marge! I thought there's good in everybody. Just paint a nice picture of him. I don't think I can. Marge, you have to! I can't make him beautiful! I guess I'm no artist. Hello. What's this? For you, Marge. From merry ol' England. From the desk of Ringo Starr! Dear Marge.... Thanks for the fab painting. I hung it on me wall. You're quite an artist. Yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England... but we call French fries "chips." Love, Ringo. Ps: Forgive the lateness of my reply. Come on, Marge, paint! I think you can do it. Okay, Homer. If you think I can. Friends, art lovers, security personnel. It's a great day for the Palace of Fine Arts. A new wing for our museum, and a portrait... commemorating the man who ponied up the dough. Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns? Smithers. I don't care for this at all. Hello, my name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me. I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head... with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain... there was a frail, withered body, perhaps not long for this world... as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures. Yes! Provocative, but powerful. He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it. Marge, a word please. You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. And incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia. I thought I did.
#02x20 - The War of the Simpsons^Mmm! "Hors doovers." Homer! You promised. That I wouldn't eat? Never. You lie. Please! We've never thrown a party. We'll pay back those who invited us to their homes. What about that bash with champagne... and musicians and holy men? That was our wedding! Oh. It's time for bed. I want to hear your witty banter. You can't have fun in bed. Oh, son, when you're older, you'll know better. Oh, baby. Mmm! Yeah. They're here! How do I look? Glasses? Gag ice cubes? Put a record on. What are their names? Hi. Please come in. You look swell. And the house! You've done.... Whatever! Anybody mind if I serve as bartender? I have a Ph.D. in mixology. College boy. Care to try my Flanders planter's punch? Why not? I paid for it. Next time put a little alcohol in it. It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon... and a little crème de cassis for flavor. Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I'm slurring my words. Give me another. Go easy on the alcohol. Remember when you threw up in the laundry hamper? No. Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you. But I don't remember you being so beautiful. A new kind of Mace? Really painful. Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party? Not really. Someone slipped one of those novelty ice cubes... with a fake fly in my drink. You fell for it! Homer... these ice cubes are made from highly toxic chemicals. A real fly is more sanitary. The look on your face. It's priceless! Bart! Come here. What? You're a little monkey, aren't you? Yes, sir. Do that cute thing you do. What? That thing you know how to do. What? Go to bed. Everybody! Look! I'm the funniest guy in the world! Oh, Homer! You're the king. I've been wanting to tell you off for years... but I never had the nerve. I don't know you. Our wives are friends. We just met. You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks. I quit! Gee, don't quit. All right. Could you... give me a... ...handful of peanuts, Maude? Oh, sure. Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom. Oh, okay. Thanks for inviting me. I had a great time. I apologize for my husband. If you want him to live, roll him onto his stomach. Thanks, I will, Dr. Hibbert. Remember, I said "if." I have never been so embarrassed in my life! Why? What did you do? Marge! Come here. Where are we going? Shh! I don't want the kids to hear. I always hated hearing my parents fight. They're fighting again. That music gives me the chills. Do you remember the way you acted at the party? The way I acted? I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini. Well said. Thank you. A fly! I put it there. You did? I slipped it in. Pure hilarity! Pure Homer! The most whimsical jape of the season. I like to think that there's no line you could cross... that could make me not love you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it. Can't we just forget it and go to church? I'm going alone. You stay here and explain to Bart... ...why you scarred him for life. No, I didn't! l-- Oh. You mean inside, don't you? You might have noticed Daddy acting strange and probably don't know why. You were wasted. I didn't know when to say when. I just hope you didn't lose respect for me. I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will. Before a preview of next week's sermon... I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets... including "Satan's Boners"... "Good Grief, More Satan's Boners, " and... for teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry in Hell." Marge? Marge? The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking... of Homer's shoes. Why don't we wait until he sits? Sorry. Sit down. We will be holding our third annual marriage retreat... at Catfish Lake. Counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread... or those in need of a tune-up. To participate... please sign up in the lobby. Will the Simpsons be attending? Oh, well. It's very tempting. A wonderful idea-- Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?! Give me that pencil! We'll be there. D'oh! Marriage encounter, here I come! You want to go? They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it that if it didn't have a catfish in it. We're going to give our marriage a tune-up. No fishing. That's the babysitter. I'm Mrs. Simpson. Simpson? Simpson? Come back for more, eh? No! What--? Where are we supposed to get a sitter? If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go! What a kick in the teeth. Why do you need a sitter? I'm 10 1/2! Mom! No. I'll give you a taste of me hand. No! Grampa? Hey! Who? What? Could you do something? I can dress myself. Could you babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate. Sure. Last resort. Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, nohow. Everyone's against me. I'll do it. Just putting a few things in the trunk. If Maggie gets sick, call here. If she sticks her finger in a socket, here. If she drinks cleanser-- Give me the list! I can read. All right. Goodbye. And behave yourselves. Call this number if he falls. I heard that! Bye, Dad, Mom! Grampa, Mom forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do. You can smoke cigars? Mmm, bait! Better get some gas. Fill her up. I guess I'll go stretch my legs. Where to? Catfish Lake. After General Sherman? Who's General Sherman? The biggest catfish around. Weighs over 500 pounds. Who says that? They do. Oh. That's the only picture of him. Can't see what he is. He's freakishly big, though. Gentlemen, I am going to catch General Sherman. Oh, my! We'll go to the video store, grab a burger... and head for the arcade. Grampa's an old man who trusts us. Is it right to take advantage of him? In these crazy times... who knows what's right or wrong? My gut's telling me: Bleed Gramps dry. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome. Hello. We're glad we could come. Hi, Helen. Hi. Homer. Here to give your marriage a little spit shine? None of your business. Say, Reverend... ...are we gonna do any fishing? Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours. It takes a weekend. Bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage... ...won't get away. I see. I also understand bowling. Our best turnout yet. Why doesn't everyone introduce themselves and... tell us why they're here? John? Gloria? My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny... hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of sour defeat pressed against me. That's enough! Thank you. Why don't you tell us about why you're here? She keeps a filthy house and talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies! No, I'm not. Here's your crown, Your Majesty! Get away from me! You've come to the right place. First, look into each others' eyes. Your eyes! I forgot how beautiful they are. Let's never fight. We were fools. Let's not talk about that. Let's not talk at all! Remember my saving your lives when we pass the collection plate. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here? Well.... Go on, Neddie. Sometimes Maude underlines passages in my Bible... ...because she can't find hers. Lucky you don't keep guns. Homer, why are you here? Oh.... Because I looked down her dress. No, no. Marge will tell us all your faults. Tell us about hers. She's perfect. What are her faults? It can be annoying. Homer.... You'll get your turn. I'm done. Okay. Marge. Well.... It's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's self-centered. Wait! Now, Homer. He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays. He chews with his mouth open, he gambles. He hangs out at a seedy bar with lowlifes. It's true. It's all true. Don't interrupt. He blows his nose on towels and puts them back. Only a couple of times. Chocolate, chocolate brownie fudge. Chocolate-chocolate chip. Check. Did she really write that list? What a question! Next? Syrup. Aisle six. All right. But put out that cigar. He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he sleeps he makes chewing noises. And when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh, and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are long and yellow. That's all I can think of. You're all tired. I want to thank you for letting me get it off my chest. We missed the luau. Let's call it a night. But I can't avenge my partner's death with this peashooter. That cannon of yours is against regulations! In this department we go by the book. Bye, book. All right! Kids, it's late. You should go to bed. We've had a big day. Wise guy. Little smart aleck.... I can't kid myself. I'm having an ethical crisis. Out at 5. Catch Sherman at 5:30. Clean him at 6. Eat him by 6:30. Back in bed by 7 with no incriminating evidence. The perfect crime. Homer? You're going fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime. But we're here to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing while I'm talking. Can I be honest? Yes. You're right, I am! Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy? Get back in bed. All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk? Sure. Gotta be a good husband. Gotta be a good husband. Gotta be a good husband. Hey, kid! You forgot your-- Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big, ugly catfish. I got a skillet and some butter with your name on it. Homer? Sugar? Ten, please. Top me off. Does your ma let you drink coffee? For the last time, yes! Come on, give up! Big blowout at casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail. Bart's joint. Two-ish. Be there or be square. Tell my friends? All right. But I've got some funky friends. I get out at noon, and I'm already invited to a party. Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you. Do I have to do this? No. I wouldn't recommend it. As a trained marriage counselor... this is the first time I've told a partner they were right. It's all his fault. I'm willing to put that on a certificate. Okay. You're probably wondering why I'm still here. You'll make me the most famous fisherman ever. Right up there with that... the... the bald guy in the cable fishing show. Holy mackerel! Good to see you. What's up? Any chicks over 8? Not yet, but the afternoon is young. What's wrong? It's obvious. We've set back the children's rights movement for decades. You're really great. Hey, you! You! Shut that door! Put that away! No! Stop! Oh! You want me to take off my belt? Yeah. All right, I'll show you. Doggone it! I love you! But I must kill you! Thanks for coming. Nice tie, Nelson. It's your dad's. I tried to be a good babysitter, but I failed. I'm a feeb. A useless, old, worn out.... I have this unpleasant feeling I've never had before. It's remorse, you burlesque of irrepressible youth. How do you make it go away? Grab a brush... and clean faster than you ever have before. Hi, honey. How's the retreat? I thought our marriage... was in trouble. But never this much trouble. How can--? You don't know what this means. This fish represents a better life for us. It makes me a hero. To who? Those weirdos in the store! This fish shows how selfish you are! Then I'll throw it back! Oh, yeah, sure. Watch! Wow! I did it. I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. One word and I toss it back. You're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby! Oh, Homer. We're back! How's the marriage? Same as usual. Perfectomundo. The house looks wonderful! What's your secret? Pretending to cry. That's right! You heard me! Pretending to cry! I can turn it on and off like a faucet. "I'm crying. I'm so sad." Way to go, Grampa. I'll never trust another old person. I fooled you! So long, suckers! Yep, General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury. No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, he's 100. No one's caught him? One came close. His name was Homer. Seven feet tall. Arms like tree trunks. Eyes like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red. Like the fires of hell.
#02x21 - Three Men and a Comic Book^Hurry, Mom! All the good comics will be gone! Good comics? You only buy Casper the Wimpy Ghost. Equating friendliness with wimpiness... will keep you from achieving popularity. I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich. Hey, they do look alike. How did Richie die? Perhaps his materialism led him to take his life. Kids, could you lighten up? Now Radioactive Man rules! He's always saying something cool. He's no wittier than others. Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, "Hot enough for you?" I stand corrected. We're here. Too bad we didn't dress up. This looks like a discount for... Bartman! Who are you dressed as? I'm Bartman. Never heard of him, full price. Rip-off. Is this on? Young people of Springfield... welcome to our funny-book convention. Thank you for pumping almost $300 into the local economy. Your spirits have imparted a glow to this old warhorse. I feel like Radiation Man! That's Radioactive Man, jerk! I stand corrected. Have fun and be sure to clear out by 6 for the Shriners. Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool of me. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear? We've got a utility belt, tricorders, a light saber.... Sorry, kid. Hey, Bart-dude. Hey, Otto-man. What's that? My own idea for a comic book. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day... but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic war zone! We're going to see Buddy Hodges. The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV? I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam. Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil. Wish I was old enough to smoke Laramies. Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're 16. Look out! Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the Earth? You know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember Dirk Richter... as Radioactive Man and not the sordid details of his final years. So keep the questions tasteful. Now, how about a big welcome for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges! Any questions? When Radioactive Man got injected... with shrinking serum, how come his costume shrinks? Who knows? I did play Rum Tum Tugger in Cats. Anybody see it? Fallout Boy! Yes, you, the masked boy. Does Dirk Richter's ghost haunt the bordello where his body was found? Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you vultures leave him alone? Hey, Radioactive Man Number 72! It's the imaginary tale where he marries Larva Girl. Wow, Number 9! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward. I'll show you something... if you'll put your grubby little hands behind your back. Behold. Wow, Radioactive Man Number 1! I bet it's worth a million bucks. It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for 100. All I got is 30. Then you can't have it. But I must. I never knew why God put me on this Earth. Now, I know. To buy that comic book. Your emotion is out of place. Did you kids have fun? Yeah. For a dollar, a man sold me 35 Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes. I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman. And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time. Homer! Just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat! You really are a sport, Dad, taking us to a fine restaurant like that. What are you getting at? I need $100 for a comic. For a comic? Who drew it, Micha-malangelo? Dad, I want this more than anything. Well, T.S. Please, Dad. No. No! Look, we all know that usually when you bug me I give in. I'm not mad at you. Shows you been paying attention. But we all know I'm not giving you $100. Now, are you gonna stop bugging me? No. Are you? Are you? Are you? No. No. No. Okay! I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Don't gloat, Homer. When I was your age, I wanted a child-sized electric light bulb oven. I didn't have the money. So, I went to my sisters. We'll give you half our allowance. lf you'll be our slave. This gives us more free time. Let's take up smoking. For months, I worked while my sisters smoked. Venus Oh, Venus We want those dress shields hand-washed and drip-dried. Because I'd worked for it... all those light bulb-warmed treats always tasted extra good. Maybe a job is the answer. I couldn't ask you to do that. Maggie and Lisa are a handful-- She means you should get a job. Me? Get a job? Were they serious? I didn't realize it, but a part of my childhood had slipped away, forever. What are you staring at? Nothing. At that moment, my dad and I were closer than we've ever-- Bart! Stop it. Sorry. I need some money A lot of money Empty bottles. Well, it's practically empty. Here you go, Apu. Shall I apply this to the cost of a squishy? No. I need the dime. It is good you're learning a trade. Americanize this. Okay. All those coins were worth three cents? Let the good times roll. This is so humiliating. I feel like such a geek. How's it going, Bart? Terrible. No one's buying. Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Let's see. Now you look pathetic. Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see. Form a line. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear. Hey, Bart, could you give me one on credit? Beat it. You got a liquor license? My dog ate it. Gotta have one to sell beer. Writing tickets must make you thirsty. Have a couple on the house. Seeing that it's a first offense.... We can overlook this. So long, officers. Hey, what's all the--? My beer, my beer, my beautiful beer! The boy is desperate. He wants money to buy a comic book. A comic book? Boys never change. Which one? Nazi Smasher? I don't think so. Send him over to my house. I've got a few chores he could do. He can mix whitewash, right? Mrs. Glick? You must be Bert Simpson. Looks like you've got a strong young back. Do you want something to eat? I've got dried apricots, almond paste, sauerkraut candy. No, thanks. Who's that? That's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long. This one's for you Kaiser Bill, from the boys in D Company: Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob, and yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to-- Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy. No, thanks. Boys love candy! I'd rather get to work. We'll start with yard work. Then you can have a barley pop. I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds? All of them? Good boy. Now be careful with these. I'll be inside, watching my stories. Jack, please. I'm married. That must be what's turning me on. Stop it. Some more. Filthy, but genuinely arousing. Finished. Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine. Iodine. Now don't fidget. Listen, lady, you don't have to-- They've never improved on iodine. Did you make any money? No, but I'm in a lot of pain. What you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. She doesn't have anybody. There's a reason. The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it? I'll sludge you, you old bat. Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is? Some old lady thing nobody's heard about for 50 years? It was my wedding dress. But then, I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress. Great story, lady. Last night, I dreamed I held you in my arms. No, not the iodine. Burn the germs off with a torch. Amputate my arm. But not the-- Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this. Yes, ma'am. Here we are, two quarters. Two quarters? You deserve every penny. I've told my girlfriends about you and they have chores too. Two quarters! Bart, you didn't say thank you. I can leave without screaming or saying a bad word. But I'm not saying thank you. You're welcome. All right, off you go to spend it on penny whistles and MoonPies. MoonPies, my butt. What's the problem, boy? I busted my hump all week and all I got was 50 cents. When I was your age, 50 cents was a lot of money. Really? No. I did everything I could and I've only got 35 bucks. I'm done working. Working's for chumps. I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out. Can I have it for $40? 40 bucks? Forget it! It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer! No way. What do you want? Can I have it for 35. No! Kids. I don't need this. I've got a master's degree in folklore. Do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973? Show me the 30 bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't getting up. Martin, if you, Milhouse and I went in together... we could buy a copy of Radioactive Man Number I right now! Here you go. I don't want it. We've got $100, and we'd like to buy Radioactive Man. Why don't you just waddle over and get it? Yes, sir! Wow. Breathe it in, boys. This is the stuff dreams are made of. It smells like my grandpa. Looks like rain. We better get this baby home. Looks like you bought more than you bargained for. My pants, caught on barbed wire! Good Lord, choke, an A-bomb! Becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man. So, that's how it happened. I'd have thought an atomic bomb would kill him. Now you know better. Turn the page, Bart. Careful, careful.... You guys can come read it anytime. Why not keep it at my house? That's crazy. It's ours as much as it's yours. How about this? Each one of us will get it for two days of the week. Wait a minute, that still leaves one day. Yeah, what about that? For that day, we'll use a random number generator. I'll take I to 3, Milhouse will have 4 to 6... and Bart will take 7 to 9. Wait a minute, what about zero? Yeah, what about zero? In the event of a zero... possession will be determined by Rock, Scissor, Paper. Okay. Excellent. Well, today being my Saturday, I guess I'll be taking my comic. Nice try. It almost worked, but tonight the comic book stays here. lf the comic book stays, then so do I. Me too. Fine. We'll all stay with the comic book. It'll be like a sleepover. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like. I wanna read it again. Nice try. Acids in your hand could damage it. We want it to last forever... so the last one alive can be buried with it. What do you mean, the last one alive? I meant years from now! Bart, don't push him. So you're both against me. Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholomew J. Simpson. Quit! You quit! No, you quit! Would you boys like some milk and microwave s'mores? Thank you, Mrs. Simpson. Sweet dreams, boys. One more step and you're dead. I have to go to the bathroom. So do l, but I'm not getting up. Hey, what's going on? Martin was trying to steal our comic. Let's tie him up! Is this how you treat your guests? Quiet. We'll take turns watching him. Okay, I'll go first. So that's your little game. Let Bart get nice and drowsy... then, when his back's turned: Wham! You're crazy. I'm telling your mom! Tell him what we do with squealers. It's worse than when you have to pee? You can't stop me! The hell I can't. Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys? They're fine. Bart, the comic! Don't let go of me, Bart! It's not that far to the ground. The rains probably softened it up. If you hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic. Shut up! Shut up! Help me! I didn't even want the comic! I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big sideburns! Better come in the house. You don't wanna get the sniffles. Now, come on. You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows. I'd raise my hand if I could. It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came. We worked so hard and now it's all gone. We ended up with nothing because we can't share. What's your point? Nothing. It just ticks me off. Well, the world is safe again. But for how long?
#02x22 - Blood Feud^Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests... I'm pleased to dedicate this warning system. In the off-chance of a nuclear disaster... this sign will tell the good citizens of Springfield what to do. Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign. I'd like to present the man who made this sign possible... by dropping his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns. He's never late. Something's wrong. Nobody leaves "Diamond Joe" Quimby holding the bag! Must turn over. Got to greet dignitaries. Oh, no! We've got to get a doctor! Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me. As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me.... He's suffering from what we call hypohemia. It's a lack of blood. Damn it, I know what it is! What can we do about it? Our only hope is a transfusion. How long to sterilize a needle? Seconds. Skip it. Just leave me enough to get home. It's not that simple. His blood is double O-negative. It's rare. I'm B-positive. Damn this gutter blood! Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot. Attention, all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death's door. If you have double O-negative blood, please report to the bloodmobile. That is all. I'd give, except for one thing. What? I don't wanna. I can't believe you guys. There's a wealthy human being who needs our help. You don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy job. I'm your supervisor. Sorry, sir. Maggie, look. What's that? Lemur. Lemur. Zebu. Zebu. What are you doing? Teaching Maggie about nature. She needs the advantages I didn't have. Lisa, we did the best we could. What's a zebu? An ox with a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dewlap. Hump and dewlap. What's my blood type? A-positive. Nuts! Rare blood and I don't have it. You know his blood type? How romantic! A mother knows everything. My shoe size? 4-B. How many teeth do I have? Sixteen. Ring? Don't wear them. But three. Allergies? Butterscotch. And? Monster makeup. Impressive. How many hairs on my head? Homie, you have lots of hair. Why do you need your blood type? Burns may die. He needs double O-negative blood. No one has it. Bart does. Yes! All right! Congratulations! You've got a date with a needle! I don't have to give blood. I have rights. Yeah, the right to remain silent. You must help those in need. It's the only decent thing to do. D'oh! It's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! When you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. You know "Hercules and the Lion"? Is it a Bible story? Probably. Once upon a time... there was a big, mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. Everyone tried to pull it out but nobody was strong enough. They got Hercules. And Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo! The moral is, the lion was so happy... he gave Hercules this big thing of riches. How did a lion get rich? It was the olden days! Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life or death here! Just a sec! Otto-man! You work here? All my friends are in school... so I got a job as a bloodletting tech-dude! Let's get this show on the road. Okay. Let me wash up. Homer. Brave, young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first. The boy. We're ready with the transfusion. I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate my epitaph. Go ahead. Charles Montgomery Burns: American... and patriot. American patriot. Master of the atom... scourge of the despot.... O, tyrant, hear his mighty name and quake! Smithers, I'm back! Top of the morning to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old you! Hi, Mr. Burns. Hey, there, Mr. Brown Shoes. How about that local sports team, huh? Mr. Burns. He's okay. Jackpot! Well, that's game. Hasta mañana, Osvaldo. I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar! Just remarkable, sir. You know, it's funny. I tried every tincture, poultice, tonic and medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. What was the lad's name? Bart Simpson. Who? The son of Homer, a stiff in 7-G. The Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. Bill. Bill. Summons. Bill. Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns. This is it. Yes, this is it! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard! Dim the lights. Turn them on. Do something! Yes, Dad. It's thin, but that's okay. Could be a check. There's no check, just a card. Don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we'll get and where to pick it up. Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns. D'oh! It's just a card! Is that some way to show your gratitude? No gold, no diamonds. No rubies, not even a lousy card! Wait, there was a card. That's what got me so mad! You don't do these things to be rewarded. You do it to help someone. You're my wife and I love you very much... but you're living in a world of make-believe. With bells and magic frogs with funny hats. We got hosed. Bart! We got exactly what we wanted. We gave an old man a second chance. I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise! I've had it! Bart, take a letter! Dear Mr. Burns... I'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your card was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink! Read that last part back to me. "You stink!" Good. You are a senile, bucktoothed old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like.... An elephant's butt? An elephant's butt. He's your boss. You have to mail it? Yep. Why don't you sleep on it? Forget it. Please, Homie. For me. Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing. And it usually works. Cheap son of a.... Homer, breakfast is ready. Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. I finally understand the meaning of.... Of what? Better half. Thank you. Where's the letter? Where is it? I don't think it is in the cornstarch canister. It's somewhere. It didn't just get up and walk away. Seen the letter? Yep. Think very carefully. Where did you see it last? The last place I saw it... ...was in my hand... Yeah? ...as I was shoving it into the mailbox. D'oh! Why did you do that? There were things that had to be said. And I know you. There was no guarantee you'd still be mad this morning. I'll show you mad in the morning! Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself! She's right. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time! Give it up. It's locked up tight. Locked, eh? I might have a little surprise up my sleeve... for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy. Hey! I'm with you, Homer. Fight the power! Why the hose? Why do you think? I'll get it so the ink will run and no one can read it. But don't other people have mail? So they won't get letters. You know the letters people write. "Dear somebody... how is so-and-so? Blah, blah, blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo." Big loss. Look out for the mailman. Give me a signal. Mailman's here. We'll use that. No, I mean the mailman's here! God! Are you planning to water the mail? It wouldn't do any good to run because you know my name, right? That's right. Well, I'm still gonna run! I want the whole world to hear the story of my struggle with hypohemia. Roman is the finest ghostwriter. He's written Like Hell I Can't. Up from the Muck. The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahabaradad. All right. First question: Have you slept with anyone famous? Countess von Zeppelin and I-- What in blaze--? Listen to me, you bargain-basement Baudelaire! I'm not a starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself! You're fired! Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me. What's your first name? I don't know. Great plan, Bart. Oh, look, Maggie! What is that? Dodecahedron! Dodecahedron! I don't know what you're doing but your father's trying to worry. "Chapter the Fifth." The trip to the infirmary with most unexpected results. Twenty-eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for Operation Mail-Take. Can I help you? Don't be frightened. It's a letter opener. Who are you? Give a fake name. Homer Simpson. Simpson, eh? Simpson! Why, there's a letter from you. I'll read it right now. "Mr. Burns, I'm glad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your card was just great." Why, Simpson! You've made my day. You're a true gentleman. Well, I'll be on my way. Hello, there's more. "In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic." You stink! You're a senile, bucktoothed mummy... "...with bony girl arms. And you smell like an elephant's butt!" Come on, Joey. You have to twist my arm? I don't tell you how to do your job, okay? I could crush him like an ant. But it would be easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until.... What the hell, I'll just crush him. Senile, eh? Bucktoothed, am I? Bony arms, are they? Liver spots, did I? Shameless, will you? His pink slip for you to sign. Now that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood and yet I feel empty. Tell you what, have him beaten to a pulp! But-- What?! Nothing, sir. I've never seen him this mad, and he's always kind of mad. Me and my big letter-writing pen. What's done is done. No matter what, we'll pull through. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids and I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means. They said I'd destroy the family. I never believed it. Nobody believed it. We were just trying to scare you. You know Homer Simpson? Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him. Beat him up. You got it. Wait. What is it? Nothing. Wait. What? Beat, but... ...don't kick. Got it. Wait. What? What did Homie do anyway? He saved Mr. Burns' life. In closing, I'd like to thank you. "What's that?" you say. "Me, thanking you?" No, it's not a misprint. I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The End. Smithers. How'd the beating go? Sir-- There was no beating. That's a hell of a thing! Why? Because l-- I called it off. Judas! I'm sorry. But I just couldn't hurt Homer. He saved you. I see. I know you're mad. I'm gonna stand outside until you forgive me. No need, Smithers. You've been the sober ying to my raging yang. Put her there, old pal. I wish this handshake would never end, but we still have... ...the Simpson matter to attend to. We do indeed, old friend. We do. Moe's Tavern. Is Mike there? Last name, Rotch. Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch! Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately? One of these days, I'm gonna catch you... and carve my name on your back with an ice pick. What's up? You're not your normal self. I got my problems. Give me another one. Don't drink to forget your problems. Yeah. You should only drink to enhance your social skills. We'll get the Simpsons an extravagant present. An unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present! Too practical. Too cutesy. Too cornball. A pool table? I'm not going to turn his home into a saloon. Eureka! We've found it! But, sir, it's $32,000! Don't you dare sully this moment with your price-taggery. It's perfect. Oh, woe is me. Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns. Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Wait, Dad, he's smiling. You brought us a present! What did you think I was gonna do? Have you beaten to a bloody pulp? To show there's no hard feelings, here's a copy of my book: Will There Ever Be a Rainbow? I haven't forgotten you. Here. Wow! A crowbar! It's to open the crate, stupid. What did I tell you? I bet it's filled with rubies, sapphire, pearls. Wow! A big, ugly head! D'oh! Actually, it's a big, ugly Olmec lndian head. It was carved by Mesoamerican Indians 3000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xtapolapocetl, the god of war. Awesome! No, Maggie, not Aztec. Olmec. Olmec. What does it do? Nothing. Really, what does it do? Whatever it does, it's doing it now. I'll let you get acquainted with Señor Xtapolapocetl. Ta. Did you see their faces? You're my god of generosity. Save a guy's life and what do you get? Nothing. Worse than nothing. Just a big, scary rock. Don't badmouth the head. It's the thought that counts. The moral is, a good deed is its own reward. We got a reward. The head is cool. Well, then.... I guess the moral is, no good deed goes unrewarded. Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that letter... we would've gotten nothing. Well... The moral is, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Perhaps there is no moral. Exactly! Just stuff that happened. But it was a memorable few days. Amen to that!
#03x01 - Stark Raving Dad^D'oh! Bart. Bart! Hey, Bart. Lisa! It's 6:00 a.m. Something's wrong. Dad died. No, no, he's fine. What do you know? I'm relieved. My birthday's in two days. I'll be eight years old. It's a big number-- almost double digits. Enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big I -0. Your legs go. Candy doesn't taste as good. Let me pour my little heart out. Sorry. This old-timer does ramble on sometimes. I do so much for you and you have disappointed me... on all my birthdays. Okay. I've made things for you-- Okay, okay, okay! It's done. Birthday gift coming your way! Oh, thank you. Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry. Can do. Hmm, Krusty Hotline. Hi, kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission-- naughty, naughty... but Krusty forgives you. Two dollars for the first minute... 50 cents for each additional minute. Thanks for calling, kids. A new message every day. Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me. Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?! I washed it. Thank you, Marge. Ahh! Pink?! I can't wear pink to work. Everybody wears white. I'm not popular enough to be different. You have plenty of white shirts. Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme. Oh, no! Pink! Pink! Pink! It's all over, Marge! It's all over! I don't know how this happened. Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle. You did this to me! I... apologize. No one will notice... if you wear a pink shirt to work. Wait a minute. Go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?! That's Homer Simpson-- a boob from Sector 7-G. Judging by his outlandish attire... he's some sort of freethinking anarchist. I'll call security, sir. Excellent. Yes, these color monitors... have already paid for themselves. Pink! I don't get his statement. Shh, shh, shh. Coming. Hey, Homer... we saved you a doughnut. It has pink frosting. Thanks. It looks-- Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing pink... doesn't mean I'm some kind of pink doughnut-eater... although it is tempting. Drop that doughnut. Let's go, pinky. You don't understand. My son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry. Spare me the tiresome antics of the Simpson family. Take him away. His body cavity search revealed nothing. We must have X-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth. Or you're in cahoots. I recall you had a penchant for bell-bottomed trousers... back in '7 9. That was my costume for the plant production... of H.M.S. Pinafore. Yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show. Doctor, what should we do... about our freewheeling fop? It used to be that establishing sanity... took months. That's all changed... thanks to the Marvin Monroe... Take-Home Personality Test. 20 simple questions that will determine... just how crazy or "meshuggener" someone is. "Print name." Oh! Hmm. Hmm! Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form. This is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you. All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it. Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form? Well, all right... if you listen to my poem. D-ohh! Okay. "'Meditations on Turning Eight' by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball. She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping. She lied, she lied! Why, oh, why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy--" No deal. Dad, you should do this. It's no different... than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot? Oh, yeah. Our $50,000 home video finalists are: "Man Breaking Hip." "Dog on Fire." Ruff!. Anyone order a hot dog? Look at him! And finally, "Baby With a Nail Gun." Aw. It's time to cast your votes. "Dog on Fire!" "Dog on Fire!" Do you hear voices? I'm hearing one now, though I'm trying to watch TV. Yes. Are you quick to anger? Bart, shut up or I'll shut you up! Yes. Do you wet your pants? Even the best of us has an occasional accident. Tsk, tsk, tsk. So did I pass? No. Bart! Careful, men. He wets his pants. Uhh... the devil with his fly open. Right. A spill on the floor with bugs going after it. Good. The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane... and who's insane? We have a very simple method. Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane. Put him in with the big white guy... who thinks he's the little black guy. Who are you? I'm MichaelJackson from theJacksons. I'm Homer Simpson from the Simpsons. I can't believe you never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer. Of course, I've heard of you. You'd have to be living under a rock-- What's your name? MichaelJackson. Doesn't ring a bell. Heard of MTV or Motown? No. "Beat it"? You beat it. "Thriller"? What was that? "Thriller." No. How about this? ♪ BillyJean is not my lover ♪ ♪ She's just a girl who says that I am the one ♪ ♪ But the kid is not my son ♪ ♪ Hee-hee-hee ♪ Wow! How do your feet do that? The moonwalk? No, your feet! Raise your heel a bit. Put a little pressure on the ball of your foot. Uh-huh. Huh? D'oh! You seem like a nice guy. Why are you here? I wore a pink shirt. I understand. People thought I dressed crazy. What did you wear? One white glove... covered with rhinestones. ♪ ...and Scratchy Show ♪ In the split second before he died... I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. Do you see how this relates to us? You want that once-a-year empty gesture? You got it. Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me. Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. He can multiply any two numbers... in his head just like that. Five times nine. Forty-five. Wow! This guy is the chief. He's been here since I 968. Never says a word. Hey, Chief. Hello. It's about time somebody reach out to me. Gee, I got to call my family. This is embarrassing calling from a nuthouse. They think I'm a god. I could call for you. Oh, great. Tell them this is one of those places... where rich women lose weight. Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em. Hello. Who is this? Bart Simpson. Who are you? I'm MichaelJackson. The MichaelJackson? No way. I'm with your father in a mental institution. Is Elvis with you? He could be. It's a big hospital. If you're really MichaelJackson... who were your last four Grammy dates? Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles. Shiver me timbers! You are MichaelJackson! Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives? I'm afraid not. Your father needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you? Hmm... lobotomy. That's all right, son. There's probably a downside I don't see. Uh-huh. New Bedlam Asylum. Loves us. Needs us. Fears he may never see us again. MichaelJackson, whoo-hoo! I love you, man. Hey, Mom... Dad's in a mental institution. Oh, my God. Mother was right. Don't you worry. Your family will be here soon. The only way out ain't pretty. What's that? Dating a nurse. I knew you'd send your father to the crazy house. You said poorhouse. I said crazy house! Poorhouse. Crazy house! Poorhouse. Crazy house! Hello, you've reached... the New Bedlam Wrongly-Committed Hotline. All our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line. What's wrong, Homer? This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy... but I'm... scared. We all get scared sometimes. Maybe I can help you. Hot cakes... football... boobies-- Bubbles, it's going to be a long night. Please express yourselves. In these sessions, we want you to feel relaxed and uninhibited. I was working at an insurance company. Youngest V.P. In the history of the firm. The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I couldn't leave the house. Was the door locked? I just couldn't face what was out there. Was it raining? No, Homer... Dave suffers from agoraphobia-- a fear of open areas and crowds. Dave, go on. I knew I just couldn't make that long drive to work. Were you out of gas? Baby. Your husband suffers from a persecution complex... extreme paranoia and bladder hostility. If you talk to him without mentioning Bart... you'd see how sane he is. You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord! Mmm, pancakes. Oh, Mr. Simpson, you've got a visitor. D'oh! Marge! Oh, Homie! After talking to your wife... we believe you're no threat to yourself or others. That's the most flattering thing anyone ever said to me. Could I have it in writing? "Not insane." Hmm. I'm proud of you, Homer. Michael, you really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us. How about today? I'm here voluntarily. You are? Why? In I 97 9, I got real depressed... when my Off the Wall album... just got one lousy Grammy nomination. Joe's Taxidermy. You snuff'em, we stuff'em. Boy, when I get home... I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck... and smother you with kisses. Whatever they got you on, cut the dose. I'm bringing MichaelJackson home... for a few days. Isn't that cute? He's heard of you. Make sure we have cold cuts, and put some beer on ice-- I'm a vegetarian, and I don't drink. Are you sure you're here voluntarily? Yes. Please make sure... he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming. Yes, Dad, I solemnly swear... I will not tell another living soul-- No, not even Milhouse. Huh? Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret? No. MichaelJackson... is coming to my house! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! Aunt Bella?! Wait a minute. I got a call on the other line. MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'n' Rumor department. MichaelJackson is moonwalking his way to Springfield. While we check it out... why don't you enjoy a seldom-heard... extra-long version of"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." MichaelJackson! Such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare leave my post? Ay, caramba! Uh, this is the most exciting thing... to happen to our fair town... since the Dalai Lama visited in I 952 and so, I hereby declare that Route 401 currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway... will henceforth be known as the MichaelJackson Expressway. I think I can see him. Oh, here he comes. Oh! The guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family... who was just released from a mental hospital. Thanks, everybody. It's great to be sane. We want Michael! We want Michael! We want Michael! Here he is. Here's the guy... you want to see! Aahh! Huh? Huh? He's 300 pounds. He's white. He's dressed without flair. What made me think... MichaelJackson would even visit this jerkwater burg? You owe us MichaelJackson. Don't ever show your face around here again, you tool. Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood... and before I join them, I have one question. Today is my birthday. You promised you'd get me something and... and I'm afraid to ask. Maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask. I thought so. Oh, Bart, you-- Come off!. I'm sane now. Dear Bart... I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me... for my birthday... to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps, if a professional so advises... I will give you a hug... at some far distant family reunion... but rest assured, it will be purely for show. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Hey, Bart. Hey, you. When I was a kid, I didn't have much money. You know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around? Stiffed them? No. I wrote them a song to show that I cared. I can't write a song. I'm only ten. When I was your age I had six gold records. Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what MichaelJackson looks like. You look like a big, fat mental patient. I often hear that. Just leave me alone. Either MichaelJackson is working... in a recording studio in L.A... or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long. Wait, wait, Michael! Go sit at the piano, and I'll boil some coffee. ♪ [ Singing To Theme From Bridge on the River Kwai ] Uh, no. Bart, we've got to get... to your real feelings about your sister. I don't have any. Let's go look at her. Maybe that will help. Oh, she looks sad. That's 'cause she knows you're looking at her. Although I know you're looking at me, I would look exactly the same, even if you weren't. Bart, think. What happens to you... when you turn eight? Well, your training wheels come off your bike. Good. That's good. You're just putting that in... because it's commercial. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. What, Bart? It's 6:00 a.m. That's right. Hope you like your present. And a-one and a-two and a-one, two, three, four. Yeah! Oh, this is the best present I ever got! Thank you, Bart. Thank you, Michael. My work is done here. What happened to your voice? This is my real voice. I'm Leon Compowski. I'm a bricklayer from New Jersey. All my life I was angry, until one day... I talked like this. All of a sudden... everybody was smiling at me. So, I kept on doing it. To make a tired point, which one of us is truly crazy? Not me. I got this. Bye-bye, Leon. You're a credit to dementia. Take it away, Lise. Hoo! Shh!
#03x02 - Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington^D'oh! Stupid junk mail. Yeah. Win this. I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am? Huh? A check? One million dollars. I'm rich! Mr. Simpson, I can assure you, this check of yours is nonnegotiable. Oh, yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure? See where it says "Void, void, void" and "This is not a check"? "Cash value 1 /20th of a cent." "Mr. Banker, do not honor." Shut up. I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars, something queers the deal. I don't think real checks have exclamation points. Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest. Marge, I never read a magazine in my life, and I'm not gonna start now. Hey, a cartoon! Ain't it the truth? No, it's not the truth, Homer. It's well-documented that women are safer drivers than men. Oh, Marge, cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh. Hey, Einstein, put down your reading. It's lunchtime. You go ahead. Hey, you don't wanna eat? What you do, get one of them stomach staples? As Tolstoy said in Quotable Notables... "Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread." Who is that bookworm, Smithers? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate. We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in Preacher With a Shovel. But lrrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear. Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds. You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine. It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap... and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket. God! Those kids don't know what they're missing. Dad! Hey, what gives, man? We're all going to sit down as a family... and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. "Then I heard the sound... "that all arctic explorers dread-- the pitiless bark of the sea lion." He'll be killed! Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article. Don't be so-- Oh, you're right. Homey, put down your magazine for a minute. Huh? I thought you might wanna snuggle. That reminds me. "Seven ways to spice up your marriage." Marge, "You have a nice body... and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask." Thank you, Homey. Wow! Little meat loaf men! Where did you get the idea for this, Mom? Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong, and it was free! Free. It certainly has enriched our lives. Wow. "Win a trip to Washington, D.C. All expenses paid. V.I.P. tour." Oh, it's for kids. Wait, Dad! An essay contest. "Children under I 2. Three-hundred words, fiercely pro-American." Sounds interesting. Bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do too. Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on. What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say, uh... "Think of a better opening." How's it going, honey? Not very well. Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore? Yes! I don't know. I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. Do kids still use that word "cool"? Yes, Mom! Okay, America, inspire me. Wow, a bald eagle. Hmm. Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad. Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine. "So burn the flag if you must, but before you do... you better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car. Oh, yes, and don't forget to burn your house... because none of those things could exist without six white stripes... seven red stripes and a hell of a lot of stars." Thank you very much. Yeah! Damn right! "Recipe for a free country: Mix one cup liberty with three teaspoons of justice. Add one informed electorate. Baste well with veto power." "My back is spineless. My belly is yellow. I am the American nonvoter." "Stir in two cups of checks. Sprinkle liberally with balances." "Ding, dong. The sounds of the Liberty Bell. Ding-- freedom. Dong-- opportunity. Ding-- excellent schools. Dong-- quality hospitals." "When America was born on that hotJuly day in I 77 6... the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth... so too did our fledgling nation find strength... in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks or such a powerful nation... could grow out of something so fragile, so pure?" Thank you. What do you think? It's good. A little too good for an eight-year-old. Me thinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy. Mr. Simpson, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daughter's essay. Lisa, will you excuse us? Okay. "We the purple"? What the hell was that? Are you a professional writer? Mm-mmm. Are you interested in politics or government? I don't know. Are you interested in anything? I don't know. Could you touch your nose for me? Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Lisa, after meeting your father... I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington. Wa-hoo! Who would have guessed... reading and writing would pay off? Yes, sir, can I get you something? Playing cards, notepad... aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin... propeller-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask... and anything else I've got coming to me. I'll see what I can do. Hmm. Steward! Little boy, I bet you'd like to visit the cockpit. Ooh-ooh, baby! And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats? No, thank you. I'd rather push this button. Oops! No! We're all gonna die! Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do. Taxi.! Oh, look, Homer, the I.R.S. Boo! Oh, boo yourself. [ Marge ] Here we are, kids. The Watergate. Hey! Homer, look.! They give you a shower cap... and body gel and bathrobes. And a welcoming mint on your pillow. Wow, a shoehorn. Just like in the movies. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off, shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Hey, I call first bedsies. Bart, there's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up. Well, okay, which one do you want? I... want... that one. Really? You want that one? It's all yours. Whatever you say. Why? What's wrong with it? Nothing. Have a good night's sleep, Lisa. No, really, what? Nothing. What did you do to it? Nothing. Mom! What the-- D'oh! Stupid welcoming mint! Hello? Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Wake-up call? It's 2:00 a.m. Sorry, fatso. Free food? Lisa, I'm Faith Crowley-- patriotism editor of Reading Digest. Oh, I love your magazine. My favorite section is "How to lncrease Your Word Power." That thing is really, really, really... good. Well, good. Lisa, I'd like you to meet some other finalists. This is Trong Van Dinh and Maria Dominguez. Hello. Maria is the National Spelling Bee Champion. And Trong has won both the Westinghouse Talent Search... and the NFL Punt, Pass and Kick Competition. Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability? Hmm? Sure, I guess. Oh, me too! These are special V.I.P. badges. They'll get you into places other tourists never see. Miss, what does the "I" stand for? Important. Oh! How about the "V"? Very. Oh! And, miss, just one more question. Person. Ah! What does the "I" stand for again? Oh! "On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to-back 300 games." Yeah, right. Wow, the president's bathroom. Do you mind? Barbara Bush! Oh, you have those damn badges. Okay. This tub was installed in I 894. Mmm. Money. Hey, watch it, chief. Folks, we print more than 1 8 million bills a day. Oh, and in case you were wondering... no, we don't give out free samples. Lousy, cheap country. Bart, get out of The Spirit of St. Louis.! Hey, what's so funny. Oh, Marge, grow up! Congressman, this is, uh, Springfield National Forest. Now, basically, what we wanna do is cut her down. Uh-huh. As you can see in our artist's rendition, it's full of old growth... just aging and festering away. In comes our logging company to thin out the clutter. It's all part of nature's, you know, cycle. Well,Jerry, you're a whale of a lobbyist, and, uh... I'd like to give you a logging permit, I would, but, uh... this isn't like burying toxic waste. People are gonna notice those trees are gone. Eh, Congressman, this is where it gets awkward. I-- I never quite know how to put this. I just want to-- Offer me a bribe? Oh, what is it? It's that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay. Could be a good photo-op. Sure, fine. So, uh, where do we-- Duh, duh, duh, Not here. I've got a little place that I use for these, uh, matters. Call me tonight. Well, hi there. You must be Lisa Simpson. Hello, sir. Lisa, you're a doer, and who knows, maybe someday... you'll be a congressman or a senator. We have quite a few women senators, you know. Only two. I checked. You're a sharp one. Well, how about a few pictures? Tot shot always plays in the sticks. Oh, isn't that nice? Now there is a politician who cares. If I ever vote, it'll be for him. Mom? Lisa, the contest isn't for three hours. I'm too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial? Who's that? An early crusader for women's rights. She led the Floor Mop Rebellion of I 91 0. Later, she appeared on the highly unpopular 7 5-cent piece. Okay, but you don't know what you're missing. Oh! "I will iron your sheets when you iron out... the inequities in your labor laws." Amen, sister. I told you no one ever came here. So, Bob, where do we stand on Springfield Forest? Do I get my logging permit? Well, let me put it this way,Jerry. Timber! What a pooch. Woof woof!. How can I read my essay now? I don't believe my own words. Honest Abe-- he'll show me the way. Mr. Lincoln-- Mr. Lincoln, I need your advice. What can I do to make this a better country? Is this a good time to buy a house? I can't get my boy to brush. Would I look good with a mustache? I tried using turpentine, but that just made it worse. Mr. Lincoln? Mr. Lincoln? My name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem! Mr.Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson... and I have a problem. I know your problem. The Lincoln Memorial was too crowded. Sorry, sir. It's just-- No one ever comes to see me. I don't blame them. I never did anything important-- just the Declaration of lndependence... the Louisiana Purchase, the dumbwaiter-- Maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time. Wait! Please don't go. I get so lonely. The truth must be told. Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Rudy, my man, you're a miracle worker. Your laundry, sir. There you go. Buy yourself something nice. Thank you. Bart, are you ready to go to-- I'll room service you.! Before you kill me... remember, this trip is all expenses paid. Thank you. Oh, this guy is awful. I know, honey, but just sit still. Welcome, everyone, to the awards luncheon. I'd like to introduce our distinguished judges... who will select our scholarship winner. Former Redskins great Alonzo Flowers... perennial third-party candidate Wilson DeFarge... Senate page Brad Fletcher... skin care consultant Rowena... and wealthy gadabout Chilton Gaines. Our first essayist will be Lisa Simpson. Lisa? Lisa? Oh, there she is. Lisa Simpson will now read her essay-- I would like to read a different essay, if I may? Um-- Okay. The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp... some 200 years ago and very little has changed. It stank then and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air. Cool! A ruckus. And who did I see taking a bribe... but the honorable Bob Arnold. But don't worry, Congressman... I'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. And this will be one nation under the dollar... with liberty and justice for none. Senator, there's a problem at the essay contest. Please, son, I'm very busy. A little girl... is losing faith in democracy. Good Lord! Congressman, we want to drill for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head. Well-- Teddy who? Congressman... you're under arrest. You work fast. I work for Uncle Sam. We will now vote on the House bill I 022-- the expulsion of Bob Arnold. Mr. Speaker, I'm all for the bill, but shouldn't we tack on... a pay raise for ourselves? No.! Okay, this should make my bosses very happy. Your bosses? Yep. All 250 million of them. When my family arrived in this country four months ago... we spoke no English and had no money in our pockets. Today, we own a nationwide chain of wheel-balancing centers. Where else but in America-- or possibly Canada-- could our family find such opportunity? That's why whenever I see the stars and stripes... I'll always be reminded of that wonderful word "flag." There will be a brief recess while the judges tabulate their votes. Lisa, what's gotten into you? Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasing. I'm sorry, Dad. I couldn't think of a nice way to say America stinks. Extra! Extra! Feds nab rotten rep. Give me one of those. "Imprisoned congressman becomes born-again Christian. " I can't believe it. The system works. He already sang this song. No, that was about the budget gap. This is the trading gap. And now the moment of truth. Will the winning essay be "Bubble on, O melting pot"? "Lift high your lamp, Green Lady"? "USA, A-OK"? Or "Cesspool on the Potomac"? Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! And now the winner is... "USA, A-OK," by Trong Van Dinh. D'oh! Miss Crowley, thank you for this oversized novelty check. I would like share this honor with all of my fellow essayists... particularly the courageous Lisa Simpson... whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us... that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Give her the check! I was serious. Ow.! Bart! Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in. Shh!
#03x03 - When Flanders Failed^D'oh! Homer, you silly goose. The weed-whacker's just for the edges. You'll be out here all day. I'm almost done. You are a picture and a half. If you're finished by tomorrow, come on over... and we'll put the heat to the meat. Nummy-nummy-num! I'll be there! ...Notty-notty-not. "The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Nedibles! Maudacious vittles!" I think it means he's having a barbecue. Why doesn't he just say so?! He's trying to be friendly. If you gave Ned Flanders a chance-- I don't care if he is the nicest guy in the world. He's a jerk. End of story. We can't hold it against him... just because he has things better than we do. Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge. You put me in my place. Oh, Homer... It's worth feeling three inches tall... to find out what kind of person you are... Marge Simpson, president of the "We Love Flanders" fan club. Fee, fi, fo, fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin... of Marge Simpson. Mm-mm-mm-mmm! Hi, Ned. Um... Homer sends his apologies... but, um... there was some important work at the plant... that only he could take care of. We now return to the Canadian Football League draft. And so, the Rough Riders... who scored only four rouges all last season,Jack... Stupid Flanders. Go ahead, Marge. Have a ball. What if they came back... and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. "We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Why did we go to the Flanders' and leave Homer alone with no food?" And I'd be laughing-- Laughing from my grave. Heh, heh, heh. What is it, boy? What? Mmm. Barbecue. Ahh. Mmm. Hey, I'm back. Nice seeing you. Hey! Oh! Hey, hey, Homer! Ahmmffluhff... Inside. Okay. Thanks for coming. You're it. Electricity. Nuh-uh! No electricity. Only in freeze tag. Okay. Now you're it! Hey! No tag-backs! Yeah, you cheater. You lie like a fly... with a booger in its eye. The fly was funny. The booger was the icing on the cake. Friends, we love you all... but I also have a sinister motive... for asking you all here... "sinister" being Latin for left-handed. But enough joking. That was a joke? Friday, I'm saying toodle-loo... to the pharmaceutical game. What's he talking about? Leaving? No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years. What are you going to do? Like one out of every nine Americans... I'm left-handed, and let me tell you... it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you drive a standard transmission. I'm opening up a one-stop store for southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers... to left-handed scissors. Going to call it "The Leftorium." So, Homer, I'm dying to know... what do you think ofThe Leftorium? It sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me. I know it's a little risky... and it's going to be a lot of hard work... but it's going to be a lot of fun too. Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz? Oh, no. The Springfield Mall. Here, you two, make a wish. Nah! It's fun. No, it isn't. You must have something you want to wish for. Hmm, let's see... Nah. Hmm... Hey! I've got an ambition to do some wishin'. Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can! Ooh! Heh, heh, heh, heh. Eh... too far. Hmm... Okay, ready. Yes! Oh, yes! Read it and weep! In your face! I've got more chicken bone! What did you wish for? No! Don't say. Otherwise, it won't come true. Ooh, that would be a shame. Wouldn't it, Flanders? Mmm. ♪ Dum-da-dah... ♪ D'oh! Bart... how many hours a day do you watch TV? Six. Seven if there's something good on. Don't you think... you should get a little fresh air? Yeah, but what are you going to do? TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend. That's the problem. Even as we speak... millions of children are staring at the TV... instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents... should be ashamed of themselves. Hello, I am Akira. Huahh!! That didn't hurt very much... because I know the ancient art of karate. Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence. People from all walks of life: doctors... Hi-yaah!! homemakers... Hu-yaah!! landscape architects... Huhh-yah!! choreographers... Haww. High karate at low, low prices. I cannot tell a lie. This is a great deal. Hohh! Hey, Mom, how about... if I learn karate? Will that make you happy? That sounds fine. See, you knock TV, and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology. Well, if it isn't The Leftorium. Hey, Flanders, how's business? Oh, a little pokey... but things are going to pick up. Oh! I am so sorry. How much do I owe you? Now that was an accident. Really? Well, thanks. Could you validate my parking? Absitively posolutely. So, Flanders, have you sold anything? Not yet, but one of the mall security guards... took a long look... at a left-handed ice cream scoop. Greetings, I am Akira... your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, The Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson. We learn karate, so we need never use it. Um... I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchukus? Yes, the impetuousness of youth. For now, let us read. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads? First you must fill your head with wisdom. Yo, Sensei, can I go to the bathroom? You can if you believe you can. Pay money to read books. The hell with this. Come on. Touch of Death! Touch of Death! Hah, hah, hah! I'm telling you. Flanders' store was dee-serted. What do you think of your bestest buddy now? Dad, do you know what "schadenfreude" is? No, I do not know what "schadenfreude" is. Please tell me because I'm dying to know. It's German for "shameful joy--" taking pleasure in others' suffering. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable... and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel-- What's the opposite of that "shameful joy" thing of yours? Sour grapes. Those Germans have... a word for everything. What did you learn in karate school? Yeah, this better be worth my ten bucks. Uh... I learned the Touch of Death. Ooh, the Touch of Death. Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace. Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it. Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Mom!! Don't use the Touch of Death on your sister. Uh-oh! Got to get back to karate class. Missed a spot. Dopey kid. Coming through. Step aside, lady. Mmm, baby. How was class? We learned how to rip a man's heart out... and show it to him before he dies. That will learn them. What did you swipe? An "I Love Lefty" glass. Left-handed pinking shears. Pinking shears? Let's go to the food court and steal... some baked potatoes. Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours? I expect things to pick up soon. I think word of mouth is starting to spread. I hear you... validate parking tickets without purchase. Oh, right as rain. Or as we say around here, "left as rain." Just stamp it. Okay. Hey, Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing? Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place. Crummy right-handed corkscrews. What does he sell? Uh... well, actually, Moe, uh... I don't know. Lise, change the channel. You change it. Ooowaaah... Okay, okay. I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back. But, Bart... Eeeyaahhh... Apple... apple... apple... Come on, candy bar. Hey, you're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really going to let them have it this time. Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk. Chop-chop! Oh, look, Smithers. Another member of our nuclear family... with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name? Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? Mm-hmm. I'm Monty Burns. "Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He's distracting the female employees." Smithers? Got me, sir. Oh, it's a real one. "No more apples in the vending machine, please." Well, that's almost a sentence. Can I leave? Of course, and don't worry. There will be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples. The note was asking you to-- No, tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She'll make everything all right. I promise. Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener! Uh, Mr. Burns... Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dying out here. Sorry, Flanders. Huh? Are you sure... you're not interested? $200 is only the asking price. Sorry, Ned. Hey, I'm flexible. You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind. Hey, Flanders, is everything okay? Oh, yeah, sure. See anything you like? Oh, it's not good enough for you... but it's good enough for me? I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello. Got your eye on the gas grill, huh? She's a butane beaut. I'll give you 20. Homer, I paid $300 for this just last year. $20. Take it or leave it. Oh, Homer, be reasonable. Sorry, no cash for Neddy. Homer keep all money. Bye-bye, Neddy. All right, Homer. $20? $20. I don't want it. What?! It was... a passing fancy. Although, if you threw in a few lawn chairs... maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest. Hey, Bartely-boobely. Care for a steakarooni? Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious, dear old duddely-doodely. [ Homer] Duddely-doodely. This is the Flanders' living room set. What did you pay for this? Only 7 5 beans. $7 5? Ned must be desperate. I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this... you scavenger of human misery. Hey! Keep your hands off my china hutch. I'm Chuck Ellis... from the Springfield Collection Agency... and I'm here to ask you why you don't think... you need to pay your bills? Oh, I know I need to pay them, but there's just so many. Do you feel good owing money? We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders. I know, but-- Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there. Oh. Flanders is in debt? Are you sure? We don't make mistakes. Damned right-handed ledgers. I can't write in these things. There's a store... You're Homer Simpson? See you Thursday. D'oh! Knock 'em dead, boy. Kid's going to be a black belt in no time. Ohhh... Check out the saxophone. Pretty boss... but something's stuck on it. Hey! Hey, look at me. I'm Elvis, man! Give that back! That to me! If you want it, take it. Okay. We're sorry. This time, we're really going to give it to you. Hey, stop that! Hey, Lise, something wrong? Not anymore! You punks are about to get... a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother, and he knows karate. Uh-oh. Oh, we're real scared. Please don't hurt us, Bart. What are you going to do? Throw your diapers at us? Just keep laughing. It only makes him madder. Start them off with the Touch of Death... and go from there. I think they've learned their lesson, Lise. We want to see the Touch of Death. Come on, Karate Kid. Waste me. It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right. Homer... over here. Flanders, I want to give you your stuff back. Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer. Not since that nice fellow from the bank-- who was only doing his job-- came and locked it up. You're living in your car? Oh, no. It's just a camp-out tonight... then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. What do you think, kids? The big city. Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back. Okay, Dad. Listen to that singing. Those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined. I know. At times like these... I used to turn to the Bible and find solace... but even the Good Book... can't help me now. Why not? I sold it to you for seven cents. You know, ever since that barbecue... nothing's gone right. It's like there's been... a curse on me. It's all my fault. No, it's not. Yes, it is. You tried to warn me... about gambling my family's future... on some pig in a poke. I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend. No, I was a swine. Listen, Flanders. Do you still have that store? For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck. You open that store tomorrow. Homer, there's no point. I said do it! Hello,Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me. A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby. "Kiss me-- I'm left-handed?" That's a classic. Whoa! It's Homer Simpson. Tell him I went out. He needs you to help Ned Flanders. Ned is in trouble?! Smithers, I'm licked. You open this can. Okay, but you softened it up for me. Hold it, Smithers. I'll open the can. But, sir, how? To the mall! I'll explain on the way. Hurry, Neddy, hurry. Oh, golly, it's a miracle. Come on, lefties. What did I tell you? Homer? It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right. The worm has turned, has it not, my tin-plated friend? Look at you-- You who were once so proud. Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns. My life today. Wow! What an icebreaker. Left-handed ledgers. Now, I can write all the way to the edge. Aha! Left-handed nunchukas. Wow! The boys at the Diners Club... will think I've gone quite mad. Oh, I'll have that roadster as well. Yes, sir. Huzzah for the shopkeep. Huzzah! Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors... but you made us friends. To Ned Flanders... the richest left-handed man in town. Everybody!
#03x04 - Bart the Murderer^D'oh! Good morning, world! Ow! Ow... ow... Good morning, Lisa. What are you so happy about? Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done... I got my mojo working, and we're going on a field trip... this afternoon. And looks like I got me... a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge. Hmm... Hey, it's not in here. You stole it! No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart. Hey, look what I got-- a genuine official police badge. Calling all cars. Come out with your hands up. Hey, that's my badge, Homer. That's Officer Homer. Lousy prize-grabbing, badge-wearing... Aah! You ate my homework? I didn't know dogs really did that. Wait! Wait! D'oh! Bart Simpson, you're late. Go fill out a tardy slip. But I'm only five... 1 0, 20... 40 minutes? That's pretty damn late. Come on, over this way. Hey, girls... look at me! You can stop looking at me now. Ooh! Well, it's nearly I :00. You know what that means. That's right-- it's time for our field trip... to the chocolate factory. Did you remember your permission slips? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Ugh! Oh, what a day. I'm going to eat eight pieces of chocolate. I'll eat it till I barf. Don't worry, Bart. We'll find something fun for you to do. Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes... for the P.T.A. You're making me lick envelopes? Licking envelopes can be fun. Just make a game of it. What kind of game? Well, see how many you can lick in an hour. Then try to break that record. Sounds like a pretty crappy game. Yes, well, get started. Oh, my God! It's Cocoa Beanie himself. I think this is something Bart would have enjoyed... but it's the only way he'll learn. Uh... uh... children, please. Uh... Welcome to the chocolate factory. I'm Troy McClure. You probably remember me from such films... as The Revenge of Abe Lincoln... and The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West. The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs. In those days... instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package... chocolate was wrapped... in a tobacco leaf. Instead of being pure chocolate... like we have today... it was mixed with shredded tobacco... and they didn't eat it-- they smoked it. You didn't believe me... when I said it would be fun, did you? No, thir. My glasses! Please, kids, play sanitary. Tan I doe now? What? "Tan... I... doe... now?" Hmm... Well, there's still a minute to go. Oh, why not? But don't you tell your teacher... I let you go early. Die don't. Aaaaah! Ugh!... Aah!... Unh!... Son of a b... Oof!. What next? Uh-oh. What's with the kid? Hands off the material. What do you know? The kid's tough. He's got spunk. I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs, third race. Make it good. Eat my shorts. Eat My Shorts. Okay, let's see. Hey, wait a minute, you little punk! That's the fifth race. I said the third race. Don't have a cow. Don't Have a Cow in the third. Put a deuce on him. While we are waiting, let me show you around. This is our bar... and our slot machine and card tables. Cool. Boss, here's the call for the third race. It's Suffering Succotash by a neck... over Yabba-Dabba-Do, Ain't I a Stinker, and That's All Folks. Here comes Don't Have a Cow flying on the outside... and it's Don't Have a Cow. I like this kid. And we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks? I don't know. I'll have a Manhattan. Make Legs a Manhattan. I'm not sure I... Mmm, mmm... Mm-hmm. Well? Su-perb. You got a job? Doing what? Uh, I don't know. Mixing drinks, picking horses... cutting cigars-- a job. Your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something. What does it pay? Thirty bucks a week. I make more than that. I was looking for those. Thanks, doll. Duh... It's funny because it's true. Well observed. Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence. Baloney! I won't rest... until one of us is behind bars--you. You know anything about a cigarette truck... that got hijacked on Route 401? What's a truck? Don't play dumb with me. Relax, Chief. You seem tense. You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan. Ah! I'm still going to put you away. Good for you. Bart! Have you started smoking? No. Don't lie to me, boy. Uh-huh! Cigarettes. Just as I thought. My boss said his warehouse was full. Yeah, right. I'm going to teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here... and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn. Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods. In here, my man. You look good with that cigarette-- kind of sophisticated. Son, I'll never doubt you again. The contents of the hijacked truck... some I 2,000 cartons of Laramie I 00s. We have... Please! We have a number of leads... and let me assure all you smokers... there is no shortage of cigarettes. How do we know that? Let me refer that back toJack Larson... of Laramie Tobacco Products. Thank you, Chief. Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies... with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor... is already heading toward Springfield... and the driver has been instructed... to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks. Police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster... William "Fat Tony" Williams. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city... and I am the... Uh, what cures cancer? Bart, is your boss a crook? I don't think so... although it would explain... an awful lot. Me and the boys thank you... for hanging on to this for us. Thanks. Uh... say... are you guys crooks? Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread... to feed your starving family? No. For a large starving family... is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread? Uh-uh. And what if your family don't like bread? They like... cigarettes. I guess that's okay. Now, what if instead of giving them away... you sold them at a price... that was practically giving them away? Would that be a crime? Hell no. Enjoy your gift. Su-perb. Give me three fingers of milk, Ma. It's good he has a part-time job... but I'm not sure... about the people Bart's working for. I think they're criminals. Ajob's a job. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town... by your logic, that would make me a criminal. Bart's been acting very strangely... and that pizza delivery truck... has been parked across the street for two weeks. How long does it take to deliver a pizza? Our cover's blown. Let's roll. See? It was all your imagination. Homer, I want you to go down to that club... and talk to them. See what kind of people they are. Please, Homie. Oh, all right. Hmm. Read 'em and weep, boys. Another pair of sixes. Beats me. I was bluffing. You win again, Homer. I am thrilled your boy... can continue to work here. If you need a hat-check girl, I've got a daughter. Homer, you're a hell of a father. Homer! What did you find out? The only thing going on down there... was male bonding. More stink lines, boys. Hmm? What are you boys doing? You didn't see nothing. Now, beat it. So, Fat Tony, you invite... me and my associates to your club... with the promise... of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield. Now you say your bartender isn't here? I don't know what happened. Louie, make up some Manhattans. I only know how to make wine spritzers. Now! What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan? Mmmmm... Come on, boys. The kiss of death. That's all I need. ...lousy Skinner. You are late for work. Of course I'm late for work! Principal Skinner kept me after school. Is Skinner causing you trouble? He sure is, patron. Hmm. Perhaps we should go... to meet and greet this individual. Come on, boys. Some large men to see you, sir. I don't have an appointment with any large men. You Skinner? I'm Principal Skinner, yes. And how did you get past the hall monitors? Children, I don't know how to break this to you... but Principal Skinner is... missing. Uh-oh. [ Gasps ] What..? Mm-mmm. I thought I found him, but it was only a cat. Chief Wiggum? Chief Wiggum? Please, I assure you... we'll be using the most advanced scientific techniques... in the field of... body finding. I see wedding bells... for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy. If we could just stick to Principal Skinner. Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits. Willie Nelson will astound his fans... by swimming the English Channel. Really? Willie Nelson? He loved fire drills. Will you get a hold of yourself, lass... for the wee bairns. Hey! Look at me! I'm Skinner's body. That is not funny. I heard he's buried under his parking spot. I heard he was ground into hamburger for lunch. I heard Bart had him killed. That's just a rumor. You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything. Wuhaa! You killed me! Nuhh... Nuhh... You killed me, Bart! You k-k-killed me, B-Bart. Reverend Lovejoy! You've come to comfort me? Yes, Bart. There, there. There, there. Kill my boy. Kill my boy. There. You're eight hours early for work. I like that. Did you kill my principal? Chinese guy with a moustache? No. My principal. That Skinner guy? No, we didn't kill him. You're all under arrest... for the murder of Seymour Skinner. What's a murder? Don't play dumb with me. Cuff them, boys. Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route... like other boys? Wait till I get you home. Who's that guy? Lionel Hutz, attorney. I'll be defending you on the charge of... murder one! Wow. Even if I lose I'll be famous. That Simpson boy is looking at I 80 years. Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime... that a child can be tried as an adult. I didn't order this guy killed. Aren't you the head of this gang? No. I just stop by the club... to read the complimentary newspaper. Then who is the kingpin, the capo di tutti capi? That's the guy. Hey! Forgive me, Don Bartholomew. We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit. Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers... The kid liked to wet his beak in everything. You've been his father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader... of a murderous criminal syndicate? Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit. In light of the testimony... from your gangsters, your father... your teachers and a seemingly endless parade... of emotionally shattered baby-sitters... this court has no choice but to... Stop! Principal Skinner! I thought he was dead. I suppose you're wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk... updating the school dress codes... when I was confronted by toughs... acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson... or so they said. We think the boy has promise. Get out! To get my mind off that ugly confrontation... I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. Suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently. I stayed alive by eating my mother's preserves... and maintained my sanity... by dribbling a nearby basketball. I made a game of seeing how many times... I could bounce the ball, and breaking that record. The police arrived to search my home. Find anything, boys? No sign of him. Princess Opal? I'm afraid it's splitsville... for Delta Burke and Major Dad. They seemed so happy. I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me. I'm in here! Well, let's go. Okay, Chief. I realized if I was ever getting out... I had to do it myself. I formed a crude rocket... from a cigar tube. Remembering an experiment from my days... as a science teacher... I concocted a fuel... from baking soda and lemon juice. The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide... dragging a vacuum cleaner cord. I grabbed the vacuum cleaner... pushed the cord-retractor button... and was on my way to freedom. And that's my courageous story. The prosecution moves... that this testimony be stricken from the record. Denied. Case dismissed. Your Honor... uh, do I still get paid? I hope there are no hard feelings. Get bent. I deserve that. I know we let you down, but me and the boys... we still think you've got a big future... in racketeering and extortion. I used to think your gang was cool... but now I learned... that crime doesn't pay. Yeah, you're right. Blood on the blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story... starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner... Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony... Jane Seymour as the woman he loved... and Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson. Let's get out of here. Shut up. Where do you want it, Skinner? Not smart. Cool! When do we get the check for this? They changed it just enough... so they don't have to pay us. You know who the real crooks are-- those sleazy Hollywood producers.
#03x05 - Homer Defined^D'oh! Here's good news. According to this article... S.A.T. scores are declining at a slower rate. I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge... of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King. This is the only paper in America... not afraid to tell the truth-- that everything is just fine. "To me bestest bud Milhouse. Happy birthday, Bart." Bart, that's so sweet. May I see the card? "I couldn't afford to get you a new drum--" Eww. Come on. Open it! Open it! Uh... maybe a little later, Bart. Just 'cause your mom didn't let you have a party-- We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse. I liked the balloons. I liked the party hats. What do you mean? Nothing. Twins. Open your present. They're Krusty the Klown walkie-talkies! I'll keep one and you keep one. Whenever you want to talk to me... call me on the phone... and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie. I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday-- jellybean baskets, personalized noisemakers-- but the little touches are what made it enduring. What's he talking about? Hey, look at that dog. Isn't that something? Wow! Brown. Whoa! Springfield Elementary, last stop. And by the way, I'd like to say... applause, applause to birthday boy Milhouse... for his totally bitchin' party... on Saturday! Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof. You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends. Sorry, Bart. Bye, little dudes. Don't learn anything... I wouldn't learn. Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay... for your two days of debauchery... you hung-over drones. T.G.I.M., sir. What did you do this weekend, Smithers? I caught up on my laundry... wrote a letter to my mother. I took Hercules out to be clipped. Who the devil is Hercules? My Yorkshire terrier. He's tiny. You know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Hurky. Wheww. Well, don't you know how to paint the town red. May I ask about your weekend? A bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. A piece of filth featuring a blonde harlot... who spent half the film naked as a jaybird. Give the great unwashed... a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending... and they'll oink for more. What a movie! And that blonde-- does she have assets! Heh-heh-heh! Sounds like my kind of flick. And how! Eww! Lemon. Ugh! Cherry. Ooh... custard. Mmm... purple! Otto, welcome. Apu, hey. Got a bad case of the munchies, man. Time for a heat-lamp dog. Did you know there's a child in your bus? Good thing you warned me. I was heading to Mexico. Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier... when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky did more with one raised eyebrow... than an entire-- Warning. Problem in sector 7-G. Good God! Who's the safety inspector there? Uh, Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Actually, he was hired under "Project Bootstrap." Thank you, President Ford. Huh? Noise. Bad noise. Five minutes before critical mass. Critical wha--? Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they can handle it. Huh? It's my problem! We're doomed! Sector 7-G is now being isolated. My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man. Sure, you will. My old lady ran off and married my brother. It hurt, but it's a month later, and I'm sleeping on their couch. Marguerita... I want you. Mr. Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions. Have it your way, baby. You're fired. Oh, Avery. Call me Mr. Devereaux. We interrupt Search for the Sun for this bulletin. Forget the hair. Just give me the blush. Oh, we're on. This station has learned that a crisis is in progress... at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Oh, my Lord! On the line is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Oh, hello, Kent. Right now, skilled technicians... are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction... ...but I can assure you and the public... that there's absolutely... no danger whatsoever. Things couldn't be more shipshape. Where's my radiation suit? How the hell should I know? People are calling this a meltdown. That's one of those annoying buzz words. We prefer to call it an "unrequested fission surplus." Homie, please, be all right. Got to think! Somewhere there's a thingy... that tells you how to work this stuff. The, um... manual! The manual, right. Aha! It's as fat as a phone book! "Congratulations on your purchase... of a Fissionator 1 952 slow fission reactor--" D'oh! Get to the point. Ooh, what's this? D'oh! Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor... would be so complicated? 90 seconds to core meltdown. There may never be another time to say... I love you, sir. Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments... socially awkward. Looks like this is the end. That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life. After the meltdown, expect roving bands-- I don't like this program. Change the channel. ...traffic for hours. Wheel of Fortune! I don't understand anything. When they look up "stupid" in a dictionary... there will be a picture of me. Dear Lord, if you spare this town... from becoming a smoking hole in the ground... I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do. Um... oh, the next time there's a canned food drive... I'll give the poor something they'd actually like... instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix. One minute to core meltdown. Shut up! Simpson, it's all up to you. It's show time! Okay, okay, think back to your training. This may well save your life one day. Homer? Yeah? This button controls the emergency override. In a meltdown, push this button, and only this button. Ooh, a side. Simpson! What? You see which button? Yeah, yeah, push the button. Got it. This is all your fault! Got to pick a button. One potato, two potato-- No, wait. Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish. How many pieces do you wish? No! No! 30 seconds to core meltdown. I guess there's nothing left... but to kiss my sorry ass good-bye. May I, sir? Ughh. These unfortunate people... will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in... will experience a slower, considerably more painful death. Good Lord! They called me old-fashioned for teaching "duck and cover"... but who's laughing now? 1 5 seconds to core meltdown. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers, let him go. Eeny, meeny, miney... moe. All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day. Whew. Will I ever see you again? Sure, baby. Next meltdown. Heh. I'd like to solve the puzzle. "Three loins in the fountain." We've isolated the problem. Wouldn't you know-- false alarm. It seems a single wayward crow... flew into our warning system. Your point about nuclear hysteria... is well taken. This reporter promises... to be less vigilant in the future. Excellent. Well, ta. Smithers, I can still sell them snake oil. Now, bring me a wine spritzer... and don't be stingy with the vino. Yes, sir. So, Smithers... it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next employee of the month. Milhouse, a little salt? Sure. Ohh! Ha-ha-ha. Now we're even for your party. Come on, let's go play. My mom won't let me be your friend anymore. That's why you couldn't come. What's she got against me? She says you're a bad influence. Bad influence, my butt! Never listen to your mother. She threatened to cut off my allowance. Whatever she's paying you... I'll double it. I'm really sorry. Sir, if you'll recall... I'm the one who put a five-percent ceiling... on the Keogh plan-- You bean counter, give it up. Simpson's my man. Hey, way to save our lives. Yeah, we owe you one. Well, you know, boys... a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman-- you just read the manual and press the right button. Simpson? Monty Burns. Come with me. Homer! Homer! Homer! Now, now... that will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill... we award you... this ham, this plaque... this discount coupon book... and my own personal thumbs-up. Ahh! Hah! And to ensure your immortality... your heroic visage will be added... to our wall of fame. Oh, and what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin "Magic"Johnson? MagicJohnson?! Yello. Is this Homer Simpson? Yeah. Homer, I just used our last time-out... to call and congratulate you... on averting nuclear holocaust. Well, thank you. If you play on that ankle, you'll be in pain. I don't care. Magic, what if people think a guy's a hero... but he was just lucky? Sooner or later people like that are exposed as frauds. Thanks, Magic. Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Hee-hee-hee-hee! Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle? No, I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him anymore. Homer, did you go out and buy a 20-pound ham? What's all this? D'oh! "For heroic competence. For narrowly averting a meltdown... and proving without question... that nuclear power is completely safe. Employee of the month!" Oh, Homer! Ohh. A role model in my very own home. How convenient. Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home. How are you enjoying your ham? Tastes so bitter, it's like ashes. It's actually more of a honey glaze. Maybe you ate a clove. What's your problem, boy? I had a fight with Milhouse. You don't need friends like that four-eyes. How Zen. What? What is it? What you doing? Looking at you with quiet awe. As long as it's quiet. Milhouse to Bart. Milhouse to Bart. Please don't hate me. Please? Ooh, right next to the boss. Aw, he'll never know who did it. Ah, Simpson, there's someone... I want you to meet-- Aristotle Amadopolis... owner of Shelbyville's nuclear power facility. Huh? What? Ari's been having terrible worker problems. They've lost their zest for work. Help them find their eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve. Their eanae-haratou-doola what? We want you to give them a pep talk... that turns them from donut-eating goof-offs... into Homer Simpsons. I can't tell them anything. Cut the false modesty! It's tiresome. Besides, employee of the month isn't all ham and plaques. Well, Smithers. How kind of you to pay us a visit. Couldn't help it, sir. Parking here is terrible. This man has no love... for his power plant. Begone from my sight. That one's always been a problem. One, two, three. "Community Chest." Nah. Nah. Ah! I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks. Ha, ha! You're losing. Bart, don't feed your sister... hotels. Don't worry. There's tons. That game is too old for her. Go play with Milhouse. I don't want to. You haven't made up? His mom says I'm a bad influence. Let's go throw rocks at that hornets' nest. Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother. We met when the boys drank paint. I remember. Please come in. Marge, I'm sorry... but I think it would be better... if Milhouse didn't see your son. Look, I know Bart can be a handful... but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing. Of course, it makes him do bad things. Well, Marge, the other day... Milhouse told me my meat loaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy... because they certainly don't say that word on TV. Well, I can't defend everything he does... but let's face it. All Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls... and they're a popular target for bullies... and in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends. I'll think about it. So the next time somebody tells you... carny folk are good, honest people... you can spit in their faces for me. If you'll excuse me... I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought I'd follow him around for a day... to see what makes him tick. Aw, that's sweet. I followed my dad to a lot of bars too. One beer, one chocolate milk. Excuse me, I have the chocolate milk. Oh. What's the matter, Homer? Alcohol's depressing effects... don't kick in till closing. He's a little nervous. He has to give a speech on keeping cool in a crisis. What will I do?! What will I do?! I gave a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear-- the judge, the jury, my lawyer-- everybody. Did it work? I'm a free man. Milhouse to Bart. Do you want to come over and play? Really? We can be friends again? Did your mom die? Uh... I don't think so. Well, who cares? Milhouse, I'll be right there. Sorry, Maggie. Game's over. Hey, Mom! I'm friends with Milhouse again. I knew his mother would come to her senses. Thanks for sticking up for me. Who says I did it? Who else would? Aw... you be good. I will. As I look into this sea of smiling faces... I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers. You are a pack... of mangy, cud-chewing, ugly goats. Well, you're in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson. Uh... "ladies and... gentlemen." Just picture them in their underwear. Whew! Ahh! "Grace under pressure... is no--" Three minutes to meltdown. Whew! Saved by the bell. 1 5 seconds to core meltdown. Just do what you did before. All right. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. Catch a tiger by toe. If he hollers, let him go. Eeny, meeny, miney... moe. Crisis has been averted. Everything is super. Thank you, Homer, for saving my plant... with that idiotic rhyming! Do you even know what button you pushed?! Sure-- moe. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. Is Homer a hero? The answer is no. I'm Kent Brockman and that was "My Two Cents." Now, Scott Christian with "Laugh and a Half." Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck today... when Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank holdup... without even trying. It seems the chief had gone to the bank... to cash in his penny jar. ...48, 49, 50. What the--? Ooh! Good work, Chief. Just doing my job. Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own. Whoa! Huh? A pretzel? Wow! Looks like I pulled a Homer. MagicJohnson coming down the floor. His feet slip out from under him! The ball flies loose, hits the referee... goes in the basket! It's a three-point play! The Lakers win! Looks like I pulled a Homer. Our dad! Now he belongs to the ages. Shh!
#03x06 - Like Father Like Clown^D'oh! I hold in my hand the final ax. Ah, heh... That's all the time we have for today. I'd like to thank Sideshow Mel... Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina... and from Knots Landing, Miss Donna Mills. Oh, she was a sport. See you some other time! Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! Great show, Krusty. I really laughed when-- You've got a merchandising meeting. Cancel it! Therapist? Cancel it! The line on the Giants is 5½/. Put a dime on it. "Thank you" dinner with Bart Simpson? I don't know Bart Simpson. The boy who saved you from jail. Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake. Ah... won't happen again. There was one boy who trusted me... all along. Bart? Yes, sir? Thank you. Oh, yeah. Cancel it! Hello? Mrs. Simpson? Lois Pennycandy, Krusty the Clown's assistant. Hello, Mrs. Pennycandy. It's Miss Pennycandy, I can assure you. I'm sorry to inform you... that Krusty will not be joining Bart for dinner. This is the fifth time he's cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so? Oh, Mrs. Simpson... I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question. I apologize for him. Something really important came up. Lousy mildew! That's good enough. Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye. How many Krusty autographs do you want? A hundred. Done. Sweetie, I'm sorry... but Krusty isn't coming to dinner again. Oh, man. "Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson... Krusty buddy number I 6302 respectfully returning his badge. I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent. Bart Simpson." Ooh, SEX-CHAT! You've reached the party line. You'll be connected to a hot party... with the world's most beautiful women. Now let's join the party. Hello? Hello? Hello? Are there any women here? Hello?! Are you beautiful? Do I sound beautiful?! This is not as hot as I had anticipated. Read this! Uh-- I, um-- Uh-- Uh-- "Dee--" Uh-- "Deee--" "Dear... Krus-s-s-t-- Why--?" It says the little boy... who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you. You will go to Bart Simpson's for dinner! But I have plans. Hey! Not the face! Why you maddening, impossible man! If you don't go tonight... I won't be here tomorrow. Oh, all right, I'll go. Oh, Krusty! But I hate missing schnapps night at the Friars Club. Bart, wipe your feet. Why bother? They'll just get dirty again. I've got good news. Krusty is coming to dinner tonight. He is? For sure? Yes. God bless that clown. Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! You think it's him? Cute kid. Oh, hi, Bart. I was just in the neighborhood-- What? Krusty the Clown! What a surprise! Milhouse, you can come in, and drop the charade. Whoa! You don't have to be on tonight. What are you talking about? Of course he does. No. Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and punchinello antics... aren't necessary here. Really? Yeah.Just relax and be yourself. Oh, that's a relief. Go wait in the car. Aw! We could have seen a monkey. Who wants to say grace? Let's let our guest do it. Bless us, O Lord-- Hey! Krusty, do the honors. Well, all right. I'm a little rusty, but, um... I'll try. Baruch ata Adonai... Eloheinu melech ha-olam... ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz. He's talking funny talk. No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must beJewish. AJewish entertainer? Get out of here! There are many prominent Jewish entertainers... including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner... and Mel Brooks. Mel Brooks is Jewish?! Krusty, are you all right? Yes, it's just that saying the Brucha brings back... a lot of painful memories. The old days... my-my father. Hey, Krusty, you going to finish... that meat loaf, or what? Poor Krusty. He's like a velvet painting come to life. Krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? Spill your guts. Yeah. Come on. Krusty, tell us. Well, okay. First of all... my real name isn't Krusty the Clown. It's Herschel Krustofski. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father-- Well, you get the idea. My father was the most respected man... in the Lower East Side of Springfield. People would come from miles around... to ask his advice. Reb Krustofski, should I finish college? Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge. Rabbi, should I have another child? Yes. Another child would be a blessing. Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler? Could you rephrase that as an ethical question? Um... is it right to buy a Chrysler? Yes-- for great is the car with power steering... and Dyna-Flo suspension. Papa? When I grow up, can I be a clown? No! A clown is not respected. I'll make people laugh. Herschel, life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing. But, Papa-- But nothing! You'll do as I say... or you'll get such a zetz... that you won't even know what hit you. Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps... but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first laughs at yeshiva... impersonating my father. Blah, blah, blah... Moses! Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps. Don't worry. I don't even like using the bathroom after you. Why, you little-- Krusty, please continue. Okay. My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug... but it was no use. What are you doing? Go away. Open the door! Oy, gevalt! Close the door! Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills. I was the entertainment. But the lord works in mysterious ways. My son, Herschel... was first in his yeshiva class. He was voted... most likely to hear God. Go on, Hyman, you're exaggerating again. A rabbi never exaggerates. A rabbi composes, he creates thoughts... he tells stories that may never have happened... but he does not exaggerate. My father would have never suspected a thing... were it not for one rowdy rabbi. Hey, funny man! No, no, no! Herschel? Herschel, oy vey iz mir! You have brought shame on our family. If you were a musician or a jazz singer... this I could forgive, but this? I never want... to see you again, you--you clown! I haven't seen my father since. That is so sad. Do you think about your father a lot? All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Oh, look! Aww... hmm. Oh, look at you, Bart. Oh, isn't that fun! Ooh, hey! Whoa! Oh, Fourth ofJuly. I can't believe that little boy is you, Bart. Yeah. I got a lot of fond memories. Look at the time. Almost midnight. Do you have any yearbooks? You've seen everything. Milhouse, know any "knock, knock"jokes? I want to go home. Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home. Gladly. Wow! The Concert for Bangladesh. Good night, Krusty. Sorry about your dad. Don't worry about me. I'm a survivor. Did I leave my keys? No! Oh, here they are. Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! Ehh... Hmm... ah... uh... ohh! Academy Award Playhouse... now returns you to Hercules Versus the Martians. Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules. Heh-heh. Hello? Hello?! Anybody there? I hear a phone ring... I'm listening, and there's no talking. Why would they call... if they don't want to talk? Huh? Hee-hee-hee! Aahh! Aahh! Didn't ltchyJunior look happy playing with his father? And didn't ScratchyJunior look happy playing with his dad... until they got run over by the thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to the commercial! Poor Krusty! A man who envies our family... is a man who needs help. We've got to do something. Let's move. Reverend Lovejoy... we need you to help us find a rabbi. Well, before you make any rash decisions... let me remind you that the church is changing... to meet the needs of young Christians. We're not converting. We just want to find a Rabbi Krustofski. I do a radio call-in show with him... every Sunday night. Really? I didn't know that. I mention it in my sermon every week. Oh, that radio show. It's all the kids talk about on Monday at school. Well, why don't you have a free T-shirt? You'll be the coolest kids in the playground. We'll put them on later. Can you give us the rabbi's address? Oh, sure thing. Let me check my non-Christian Rolodex. I bet he misses Krusty. He'll be so happy, he'll cry in his beard. Oh, yes, yes. Rabbi Krustofski? What can I do for you, my young friend? We came to talk about your son. I have no son! Great, we came all this way, and it's the wrong guy. I didn't mean that literally! And in order to keep our broadcasting license... we devote Sunday night dead time... to public service shows of limited appeal. In that spirit, we bring you Gabbin'About God... sponsored by Ace Religious Supply, where they say... "If we don't got it, it ain't holy." With us once again, our very own three wise men-- Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daly... and Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. Our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights. With all the suffering in the world... do you ever wonder if God really exists? No. Not for a second. Not at all. Good conversation there. Our next call now is for the good rabbi. Hello? I hear breathing, but I don't hear talking. What's going on? Hello? Mister? Some people got nothing to do but call and hang up. There's all kinds of mishagoyim. Our next caller is a Springfield boy. My name is Dmitri. I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener. If a son defies his father and chooses a career... that makes millions of children happy... shouldn't the father forgive the son? I think so. Of course. Absolutely not! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? They leave a building without people watching it? I got a plan that can't fail. Yiddle, my man, you're a genius. I love my work. Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know. But what if your example encourages others to give? Speaking of charity... don't you think it's time you forgave your son? My boy broke my heart! He turned his back on our traditions... on our faith, and on me. Get out of here, you little pisher. Oy, this guy's tough. We'll have to outsmart him. He's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise. What? Saul Bellow? The Nobel prize-winning Jewish novelist? He wants to have lunch with me? It's a date. Izzy's deli, I :00. I'll be there. The French government... wants to give me the Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy's deli, I :00. Thank you, Monsieur President. Au revoir. Are you kids ready to order yet? Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles. Watch how fast I go. And for you, sir? I want a nice sandwich, but theJoey Bishop-- too fatty. TheJackie Mason-- makes me gassy. The Bruce Willis? I don't like his work. What is this-- a Krusty the Clown? Ham, sausage and bacon, with a smidge of mayo. What? On white. You tell Mr. Saul Bellow... the Nobel prize-winning Jewish novelist... that I lost my appetite. Could you direct me to President Francois Mitterand's table? You think you're funny? 50 million Frenchmen can't be wrong. We've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else? Those stupid hats? No, Bart-- knowledge. We'll hit him where it hurts-- right in theJudaica. "Glub, glub, glub." "Oh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us!" "No!" This looks good, Bart. Take it to him. You I told to go away. Does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... "a child should be pushed aside with the left hand... and drawn closer with the right"? Yes. Your religion commands... you make up with Krusty. But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says... "Honor thy father and thy mother." End of story. Oh, it's hopeless. Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon Ben-Eliazar. "At all times let a man be supple as a reed... and not rigid as a cedar." Bart, my short, learned friend, the Book ofJoshua says... "You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night." Hmm. Is it not written in the Talmud... "who will bring redemption? The jesters." I'm still not convinced... and this is hardly the time to discuss it. Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but that's all I can do... without learning ancient Hebrew. Bart, I am not going to learn ancient Hebrew. Rabbi, did not a great man say... and I quote, "The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution... but what they went through is ridiculous. But the great thing is after thousands of years... of holding on and fighting... they finally made it." End quote. I never heard the plight of my people... phrased so eloquently. Was that Rabbi Hillel? Nope. Judah the Pious? Maimonides? The Dead Sea Scrolls! I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from Yes, I Can, by Sammy Davis,Jr. An entertainer, like your son. The candy man? Maybe I'm completely upside down on this whole problem. All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways. There, there, Rabbi. It's not too late. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, kids. Today's show's going to be... the funniest, side-splittingest cavalcade of-- Aw, the hell with it. Roll the cartoon. Oh, yeah. My old friends, right next to my heart. Hey, such a filthy habit. Who asked you? Father? Son. Papa! Herschel! Daddy! Boychick! Oh, Daddy! You're on, Krusty. Oh, uh-- Boys and girls... I'd like to be serious for a moment, if I may. Spotlight, please. I just wanted-- I just want-- Come on, guys. I'm not doing the spotlight bit. Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father... Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. Lenny... a little reconciliation music, if you please. Come on, Dad. You know the words. I got something in my eye. Take my hankie. Eeyugh! We haven't seen each other in 25 years! Oh, I love you, son. I love you, too, Daddy. Oy, a klop tsu deer! Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! 
#03x07 - Treehouse of Horror II^Hello, everyone. Before last year's Halloween show... I warned you not to let your children watch... but you did anyway. Well, this year's episode is even worse. It's scarier, more violent... and I think they snuck in some bad language too. So please, tuck in your children and-- Well, if you didn't listen to me last time... you're not going to now. Enjoy the show. ...to conclude this Halloween newscast on a scary note: remember, the presidential primaries... are only a few months away. Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia. Trick or treat, man. Aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes. Hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house. Here you go, kids. Heh-heh... heh. Lousy punks. D'oh! We're home. Aah... whoo! Get a good haul this year? Jackpot! I'm very, very proud of you kids. We would have gotten more if Lisa walked faster. I didn't select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest. Yaahh! Ha-ha-ha! Children, you can have one piece of candy tonight... and save the rest for-- If you eat too much, you'll have nightmares. Oh, yeah, everybody in this family... will have a bad nightmare tonight. Oh, yeah, three bad nightmares. I'd like to see that. Heh-heh-heh. Ooh. What a dump! Why would Princess Grace live here? Dad, that's Monaco. D'oh! I can do that, but I don't want to. Ugh! What is this thing? It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Al-Al Ben Abdallah. It grants wishes to its owner. Oh, yeah? How much? I strongly advise you, do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I was once president of Algeria. I don't want to hear your life story. Paw me. Eww, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing? Why, at that little shop right over... there. Oh, it was over there. You'll be sorry. Flight 7, Marrakesh to Springfield, now boarding. Just a moment. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! They're souvenirs. You must pay a fine of two American dollars. Okay. Let's wish for X-ray specs that really work. No, Bart-- peace on Earth. X-ray specs. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. X-ray specs. X-ray specs. Peace on Earth. As the pants-wearer of this house... I get the first wish. Homer, there's something I don't like... about that severed hand. Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is going to make our dreams come true. Oh, no! Maggie made a wish. Oh, my land! Ooh.! A luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie. Ohh, a new pacifier. D'oh! No more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for Simpsons to be rich and famous. Now you're talking. Yay! Yay! Wahoo! Look, everybody. My purse exploded! Come on, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town. I'm terrible sorry. I have absolutely nothing untilJune. Ah, the Simpsons! Right this way, please. Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say. If I hear one more thing about the Simpsons... I swear I'll scream. At first they were cute, but now they're annoying. 1 8 bucks for this? What a rip-off. Man, this thing's really getting out of hand. Is there anything they won't do? Oh, Homer, this is awful. The guy that sold me this thing... did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was being colorful. I wish for world peace. Lisa, that was very selfish of you! Sorry about the Falklands. Oh, forget it. We knew they were yours. Well, won't be needing these anymore. ♪ Come on, people now, smile on your brother ♪ ♪ Everybody get together ♪ ♪ Try to love one another right now ♪ Foolish humans. Oh, yes, Kodos. Earth is now ripe for the plucking. People of Earth, we come to you in the spirit of hostility and menace. Now, we can resolve our differences peacefully. Uh... ow! Your superior intellect is no match for our puny weapons. Gordon, do something. What do you want me to do? I'm a baker now. Conquered with a club. Wish we'd saved an A-bomb. Move along humans. This is all the Simpsons' fault. Before I was just bored with them... now I wish they were dead. Geez, now we're slaves. This paw sucks. Okay, I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread... with lettuce and mustard... and... and I don't want any zombie turkeys. I don't want to turn into a turkey myself... and I don't want any other weird surprises, you got it? Hey! Hmm... mmm! Mmm... not bad. Nice hot mustard, good bread... turkey's a little dry-- The turkey's a little dry?! Oh, foul the cursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee? Hey, is that one of those monkey paw dealies... that lets you wish for things? Yeah, but I got to warn you that this thing is-- Yeah, that's what it is. You want to try it? Okely-dokely. Ooh, would you look at that. Aahh! Kneel before my slingshot, puny earthling! Well, I guess my first wish... is to get rid of those awful aliens. Aahh! He's got a board with a nail in it! Enslave humanity, will ya?! Run, Kodos! Ha-ha-ha! Well, Kang, it seems the earthlings won. Did they? That board with the nail in it may have defeated us... but the humans won't stop there. They'll make bigger boards and bigger nails. Soon they will make a board with a nail so big... it will destroy them all! Hey, Homer... this thingumajig works great. Now that I've saved the Earth... maybe I ought to spruce up the old homestead. I wish I had a monkey's paw. Bart? Bart? Huh? What's the matter? I had a bad dream. Could I sleep in your bed? No. I'll give you a candy necklace. Climb aboard. Thanks, Bart. Less talk, more sleep. [ Rod Serling lmpressionist ] Presented for your consideration:: Springfield-- an average little town... with a not-so-average monster. Happy thoughts. Happy, happy, happy. The people of Springfield have to make sure... they think happy thoughts and say happy things... because this particular monster can read minds. And if displeased, can turn people into grotesque walking terrors. Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts. Boy, I'm getting mighty sick of this. Huh? Ruff, ruff, ruff. Bow-wow. And did I mention that the monster... is a ten-year-old boy? Quite a twist, huh? Betcha didn't see that one coming. Good morning. Morning. Good morning, dear. Hiya, Bart. How's my boy? [ Nervous Laughing ] Every day, same old cat. I'll make him more interesting. Much better. Oh, good, the curtains are on fire. It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good. Hadn't you better get ready for school? Okay. He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side. Hi, guys. Aahh! Hi, Otto. Move over. I'm driving. No can do, little buddy. See, there's a rule-- Oh, wait. You're the little dude with the gnarly powers. Quit riding the brake. Give it some gas, man. Hey, this is fun, isn't it? We're going to die, aren't we? Hiya, Bart! Hiya, Bart! [ Teacher ] Well, class... the history of our country has been changed again... to correspond with Bart's test answers. America was now discovered in I 942 by... "some guy." And our country isn't called America anymore. It's Bonerland. Your attention, please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one's for you. Phone. Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts. Moe's Tavern. Hold on. I'll check. Uh, hey, everybody. I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt... and my butt smells and I like to kiss my own butt. That's a new one! Wait a minute. One more time. Double-time now. I love school. Come on, come on. Make it, make it. Please, please, please. I want to watch Krusty. Shut up, boy. If they make this field goal, I win 50 bucks. The kick is up. It's looking good. The ball is turning into a fat, bald guy. Aahh! Oof!. It's no good, and you know what we say... Every time something strange happens-- it's good that Bart did that. It's very good. 346 consecutive hours... and all because of one little boy who-- who won't let me stop! Anyway, now let's go over and see if Sideshow Mel... has any more of those legal... over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his. Slowly, slowly. Don't make a sound. Don't even think. He can hear your thoughts. Then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in. End of monster. Aaaaaaaaaahhh! Bart! Lisa did it. That's it, young man. You're coming with me. Please? You like attention, don't you, Bart? Do I ever. But you don't care... whether you get good attention for, say... getting high marks in school, or bad attention for, say... turning your father intojack-in-the-box. Homer, I see you agree with my theory. I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning. That's too bad. The attention the boy craves should be coming from you. Spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him. [ Cheering ] D'oh! Whoa-oh-oh. Eeyii! Good night, son. Good night, Dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish I could repay you. Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back. You got it. Oh! Hey, hey. Oh, oh. Thanks, boy. I love you, Dad. I love you, son. Aaaaaaaaahhh! Mom! Dad! My goodness! What's wrong? We both had nightmares. Can we sleep with you? You both toilet trained? Yes! Okay, then. 4:00? Couple hours I have to get up and go to work. Got to go to work. Go to work-- [ Burns ] Ooh, look at them, Smithers-- goldbrickers, layabouts, slugabeds. Little do they realize... their days of suckling at my teat are numbered. Oh, in the meantime, sir, may I suggest a random firing... just to throw the fear of God into them? Very well. Eeny, meeny, miny-- Blugh! Him! Attention, Homer Simpson. Attention, Homer Simpson. Wake up, Homer. What? Huh? What? You're fired. For what? For sleeping on the job. How did you know I was sleeping? We've been watching you on the surveillance camera. Camera? D'oh! Smithers... to the laboratory. You know, Smithers... I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. I replaced the flesh, which is weak, with steel... which is strong. Behold! The greatest breakthrough in labor relations... since the cat-o'-nine-tails! How long till it's running? Keep your pants on, Smithers. First we need a human brain. Hey, here's a goodjob, Dad. You have to know how to operate an ultrasonic lithontriptor. How hard can it be? Hey, Dad, here's one. $28 an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people. Ooh, what job is that? Grave digger. Deeper, wider, faster. I wouldn't bury my turtle in that mud puddle. What's the use? Sheesh! What a slave driver. What corpse should we unearth, sir? I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store. Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly. The stench is overpowering. Wait a minute, sir. That's Homer Simpson. He wasn't exactly a model employee. Well, who is a model... employee? Simpson will do just fine, sir. Did you hear that, sir? No, I didn't. Who is it, Frankenstein? The Boogerman? The man in the bag. I think he's alive. Oh. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied? Thank you, sir. Excellent. Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop. Ice cream scoop? Damn it, Smithers! This isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery! All right. Hello. Look at me-- I'm Davy Crockett! Look, Smithers, a twitch. It's moving! It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad. Well, who's mad now? Hi, there. I'm your daddy. [ Homer's Voice ] Mmm! Mmm! Sprin-kles. Geraldo Rivera... Madonna, and a diseased yak. [ Lisa ] Mom, what's wrong? It's your father-- he's missing. Dad's missing? Get out of here. He's been gone for two days. What do you know? She's right. It wasn't supposed to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty... not this abomination. Oh, Smithers, I was wrong to play God. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Take out that brain and flush it down the toilet. His family might appreciate it... if you returned the brain to his body. Come on. It's I 1 :45! Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy-dog eyes-- All right. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Quit your complaining. Do you know what this means? He is alive. Ooh, you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a Coke. And as for you, you clinking, clattering cacophony... of collagenous cogs and camshafts, take... that.! Aahh! Run, sir. Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids... a slight headache, loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die. Is there nothing I can do? Well, perhaps. Smithers, go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are... surgical tools and some ether. Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh! Did you have a nightmare? No. Bart bit me. You were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab. Got to shake the dew off the lily. Aahh! Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads. My body was crushed, so I had head grafted onto your... shall we say, ample frame. I can wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream. Oh, that's right. It's all a dream... or is it? Next week on The Simpsons: Don't forget, Dad. Tonight my class is having... an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner. Mmm. Spaghetti. But, Homer, tonight's our reception... for Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Oh, I hate having two heads.
#03x08 - Lisa's Pony^Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh, what? Hello? Dad, the school talent show-- I know, it's tonight. I broke my last saxophone reed. I need a new one. Isn't this something your mother's better at? I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy... and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement. Wow. And after them... out of all the people in the world... you chose me. Uh-huh. Number 4½/ reed. Got it. You're in for a whale of a show tonight. The doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out... after your own child has performed. Let me caution the people in the first five rows-- You will get wet. Just in the nick of-- Mmm. Beer. I've only got five minutes till the music store closes. Go there first. Do I tell you what to do? Sorry, Homer. Tip the glass. Sorry, Homer. This is a whole lot of nothing. I'd rather watch the boilers. Make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria. I'm not kidding. Ah... finished, with I 5 seconds to spare. Ah! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! What's the matter, buddy? The moron next door closed early. I happen to be that moron. Oh, me and my trenchant mouth! Oh, terrible,just terrible. They seem to get worse every year. Ha, ha, ha! Wonderful! This is the best batch we've ever had. And now, here's Bart Simpson... the boy of a thousand voices. I'd like to open with my impression of... Principal Skinner. Duh, look at me. I'm Principal Skinner. That young man just became... the boy of a thousand days detention. I wonder what lunch lady Doris has for us today. Today's special is refried... dog poop. Please! You've got to open that store. Let me think about it. Uh... no. Okay, but I want you to see a picture... of the little girl you're disappointing. Well, I don't have one. Come on,Jer. Open up. I pulled you out of that burning car. Okay, but now we're even. What does your daughter need? I wrote it down. "Number... Number 4½/--" Stupid gum! "Number 4½/ reed." Whoo-hoo! Mm-hmm. What instrument does she play? I don't know. Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed, I'll sound terrible. Don't worry, honey. I'm sure your father is... maybe-- No. That's a long shot. Bingo. Don't worry. He'll be here. Clarinet? Oboe? No. Saxophone? No. What was that last one? Saxophone. Hmm... Lisa, stop playing that stupid-- Saxophone! That's it! Alto or tenor? D'oh! This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen... I'd like to put this filth behind us... and let's all enjoy... Lisa Simpson's rendition... of"Stormy Leather." Uh, "Weather." Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawn mower. Ew, I'd hate to be that kid's father. Uh-oh. That will do. It's not my fault. It's the reed. Oh, yes, of course. It's the reed. Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson... and her wacky sax. Yeah! Whoo! Must be her father. Whoo, yeah... Who ordered a Mount Bellyache? I ordered it for my little girl. I'm done. Oh! That cost $88! I don't feel much like eating. Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right. I hope you can forgive me. I forgive you. D'oh! You didn't mean that. No, I didn't. Look, Homer... Lisa's taking her first steps. You're taping it? Yes. I'll watch it later. The plane, the plane! No, my freakish little friend. Hmm. Da-da. Da-da. Did you hear that, Homer? Marge, please-- I'm busy. No wonder she hates me. Oh, I never even noticed she was alive. If you want to make up with Lisa... spend some time with her. Ohh! Okay! Ahh! Maybe I should give up on Lisa... and make a fresh start with Maggie. Stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you. If I spend any more time doing girl things... I'm going to, you know, go fruity. No, you were right the first time... with that quick fix idea. Let's see-- quick fix, quick fix. I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for. We can't afford it. With today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to. Ridiculous. When I look in Lisa's eyes... I don't see love. That's no reason to buy a pony. When you yell at me, I see love in your eyes. Stick to the subject. ♪ Uh-huh you love me ♪ Let's be realistic. A pony is expensive. We have enough trouble paying bills as it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Promise me you won't buy a pony. Hmm. Was that a yes or a no? Baa. Those aren't even words. Sna. Oh, my, what's that smell? Oh, it's you. Excuse me. Do you sell ponies? Sure, pal. Right here. "Scottish Deer Hound." Hey, this is a dog! My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401 . Merely take a left at the rendering plant. Lady, I'm buying a pony for my little girl... and I don't care what it costs. Very good. That stunning creature over there... is half a million dollars. Half a million dollars?! He was sired by Seattle Slew. His mother won the Kentucky Derby. His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania. Sold. Mr. Simpson, do you have... half a million dollars? Sure, let me write you a check. Mr. Simpson... this check is dated January I , 2054. Is there a problem with that? Our ponies start at $5,000... cash. Isn't there like a pound... where you can pick up cheap ponies... that ran away from home? I sincerely hope not. I'd like... to borrow $5,000. Sorry. I can't approve a loan that size myself. Hello. "Simpson." How can I help you? Mr. Burns, you do this personally? It's a hobby. I'm not in this for personal gain. Are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws? Usury? Silly me. I made up a word that doesn't exist. What is the purpose of this loan? I want to buy a pony. Isn't that cute? He's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it? It's for my little girl because she doesn't love me. Shut up, Simpson. You have any collateral? Smithers, let's not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours. Sorry, I was just thinking... of something funny Smithers did today. I didn't do anything funny, sir. Shut up. Mr. Simpson... are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony? Of course. Simpson, you've done it again. Oh! I love you, Dad! Mmmmm. I am very upset with you. Sounds like someone's angling... for a pony of her own. How come Lisa gets a pony? She stopped loving me. So get me a moped. I know you love me, so you don't get squat. Snowball II, Santa's Little Helper-- This is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different. Where were you planning to keep this horse? I've got it figured out. By day, it will roam free around the neighborhood... and at night, it will nestle snugly... between the cars in our garage. Dad, no! That's illegal. That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me. Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable. Stable? That sounds expensive. This is what love costs a month? These are standard fees, Mr. Simpson. Plus, I'm teaching your daughter riding, grooming... and at no extra charge, pronunciation. You've made me the happiest girl who ever lived. Oh, nuts. What do I do? What do I do? If you want to go right... move the joystick left. Yes. Move the-- What's a joystick? Oh, oh! Here comes a Xylon cruiser! Go into hyperspace! Wait! Where's the hyperspace? Grandpa, you're the spaceship. I thought I was this guy. Oh! Oh! Game's over. I got down on the floor for this?! Wait, Dad. I've got something for you. I was hoping... it would be money. Hmm, dear. We're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries. Well, we're always buying Maggie... vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have. We could cut down on beer. We're not going to do that. Then there's no choice but to give up the pony. First you didn't want the pony. Now you want me to take it back. Make up your mind. Homer! Lisa loves me. The pony stays. You got us into this. You get us out. There's plenty of money out there... for a guy who's willing to work. Do you have any jewelry you don't need? Mmmmm. You're so beautiful. Oh, you haven't touched your salt lick. Num-num. Good salt lick. Need money. Need money. One scratch-for-cash. Here you go. Liberty bell. Two liberty bells. Come on, come on, come on-- Oh. Yes! Whoo-whoo! Three liberty bells! That will be $1 0,000, Apu. Congratulations, Mr. Homer. Thank you. If I could see the ticket-- There it is. Please to be removing your thumb. No. Yes, please. I must insist. No. No. You can't see-- Yes, I must-- No! Let go! You're ripping it. A cherry. Oh, Mr. Homer... what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery? Oh... I need money. If you need money... you should have jammed a gun in my ribs... or inquire about my help wanted sign. You need help? Someone for the demanding... high profile midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift. I'm your man. You're hired. I dreamed of the day... one of you would work for me. She certainly tamed that horse. But what man can tame her? I won't lie to you. On this job, you will be shot at. Each bullet wound is a badge of honor. "Badge of honor"-- Here's a pointer. Try taking it in the shoulder. These hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There is only one bozo who comes in and buys them. But I eat-- Oh. The perfect crime. Homer, where have you been all night? I was so worried. Let's go in the other room. I did something I'm ashamed of. The kids can't hear it. Busted. I'll work midnight to 8:00. Come home, sleep five minutes... eat breakfast, sleep six minutes, shower. I have ten minutes to bask in Lisa's love... Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy. Oh, my God, she killed him. Mmm. Salty. Homer! Are you stealing Squishies? No, sir. This next song is also... about a girl and her pony. It's called "Wildfire." Come on, Apu, honey, loosen up. Ohh! I'm sorry, baby. While I'm here with you... my store is going down the tubes. Three dollars and 51 ... 52... 53 cents. Homer, you are asleep at your post! Go change the expiration dates... on the dairy products. Yes, sir. Sorry, baby. Date's over. Homie, how long do you plan to do this? I don't know. How long do horses live? 30 years. D'oh. Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core. Hello? I called to say I love you. Thanks. When is she going to stop loving me? I heard Milli Vanilli was arrested... for impersonating a McNugget. Well, it's still fun to be up late. Hey, Homer, where you going? Going for... eight-hour walk. Homer. Homer. Homer sleep now. What's wrong with Dad? He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know what it costs to keep a pony? No. Well, it's a lot. Your father had to take a second job. Poor guy. Where's he working? The Kwik-E mart. I hope you realize... that your father can't keep this up. You're making me give up Princess? We can't make you. I can make her. Give me five minutes alone with her. No, Bart. No one's making her. Lisa has to decide for herself. All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult... have blown up in my face. Hey! When I ordered... that blueberry Squishy, I meant today. Coming right up, sir. And fill it to the top time. Yes, sir. She likes a little carrot after her oats... and she likes it... when you scratch her behind the ear. She likes contemporary adult radio in the morning... and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess. Although there is no change in my patrician facade... my heart is breaking. I'll never forget you. What the? You call this melted cheese receptacle clean? The young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. You see, Lisa... grown-ups have a thing called money. Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony. You did? There's a big dumb animal... I love more than that horse. What is it, a hippopotamus? I mean you, you dummy. Oh. Apu, you can take this job and restaff it. Giddy-up, Dad! He slept, he stole... he was rude to the customers. Still, there goes the best damned employee... a convenience store ever had. Shh!
#03x09 - Saturdays of Thunder^Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Dome. TheJet Walker. Mr. Sugar Cube. That baby changed our lives. I'm actor Troy McClure. You might remember me from such TV series as... Buck Henderson, Union Buster... and Troy and Company's Summertime Smile Factory... but I'm here to tell you about Spiffy... the 21 st century stain remover. Let's meet the inventor-- Dr. Nick Riviera. Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody. Hi, Dr. Nick. Troy, I brought with me the gravestone... of author and troubled soul, Edgar Allan Poe. One of our best writers. Yes, but unfortunately a century of neglect... has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore. I guess we're gonna have to throw it away. Not so fast, Troy. With one application of Spiffy... you'll think the body's still warm. Ooh! Ahh! "Quoth the raven--" What a shine! Ooh! That's one clean tombstone. Dad, you got a power drill? In the garage. I'm offering three bottles-- enough to clean I ,000 tombstones-- for only $39.95. Boo! I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better, Doctor. Yeah, give us a break, Doctor. But how can I make it lower than $39.95? Find a way. I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw. If stuff starts flying just turn your head. Check. Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle... the applicator glove... and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold-- $29.95. D'oh! D'oh! Okay. Okay, calm down. Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters. Homer, be nice. Okay, I will. I will. Coming over here-- Patty, Thelma, what a pleasant surprise! What do you know. He's wearing pants. I owe you lunch. Ugly. Ugly. Butch. What's the matter? Can't you find a hairstyle you like? Hold the phone. That's the one for me. Ed Asner? No, next to him. Mary Tyler Moore. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Expiration date,June I 989... uh, 201 2, yeah. Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Shh! They'll hear you. Oh, who's using the power tools? I don't know. Some guy, I guess. We're going to the beauty parlor. You should do something with the kids while I'm gone. Oh, sure, great idea. I'd love to. D'oh! Did you hear that? Yes. How much? Everything. What's the quickest, easiest way to do something with you? Take us to the video store? Anything for my little girl. Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid. Ooh! McBain. Mm-mm-mm. McBain, you keep eating them hot links you never gonna make it to a pension. Come on, live a little. No, thank you. I got me a future. I'm two days away from retirement. My daughter's graduating from college. Little Suzie is growing up. As soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I... are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened a boat. Yes, sir, everything is gonna be just perf-- Aaah! Damn, damn, damn. McBain. Yes? I'm not gonna make it. Oh, stop talking crazy. Just do one thing for me. Get... Mendoza. Mendoza! You want to rent it, sir? Why? I just saw the best part. Ooh. Death by Knockout, Blood on the lce. Ho, ho! Football's Greatest lnjuries. Lisa, we're going. But I can't find Happy Little Allison Tinkly-Winkly Town. Just grab something. All these movies are great. Look at this. "Test your F.Q.-- Fatherhood Quotient." Maybe you should try it on Homer. He'll fail it. Uh-huh. In a second. Well, I don't know. Oh, now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. "I don't always keep my cool like the Fonz... but my love for my kids has given me plenty of happy days." Mmm. They call him the Galloping Gazelle. His habitat-- the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two Pro Bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone... until one fateful Sunday in November... when the Gazelle was stopped in his tracks... by a big cat named Wayne Shashefski. Homie, we're back. Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile. Could you turn off the TV? There's a test I want you to take. Oh, great. You made me miss Joe Theisman. This is from the National Fatherhood lnstitute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father. Oh, Marge. Question one. "Name one of your child's friends." Uh, let's see, Bart's friends. Well, there's the fat kid with the thing. The little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets. They want a name, not a vague description. Okay. Hank? Hank? Hank who? Hank...Jones. Homer, you made that up. Question two. "Who is your son's hero?" Steve McQueen. That's your hero. "Name another dad you talk to about parenting." Next. "What are your son's hobbies?" He's always chewing on that phone cord. He hasn't done that since he was two. Then he has no hobbies. Oh, really? Maybe you should go out to the garage and see. Bart. Bart! What? Do you have any hobbies? No, not really. Well, that's what I-- Wait a minute. What are you doing? Building a soap box derby racer. D'oh! That's a hobby. Hey, so it is. Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy. I'm a bad father. You're also fat. I'm also fat! National Fatherhood lnstitute. Please hold. National Fatherhood lnstitute. Dave speaking. I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero. Good Lord! A zero? Lana, cancel my I :00. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood-paneled station wagon over for you immediately. Hey, Bart, where did you get the lumber? As three-time derby champ Ronnie Beck says... "Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine." A conventional design. Yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? In between other projects. If you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel. Good-bye, son. Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away. Maybe it's for the best. For starters, Mr. Simpson... take this copy of Fatherhood by Bill Cosby. If he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold. If you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son. That's easy for you to say... you preachy, egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son? Why don't you ask him yourself? Homer, meet Dave,Jr. Huh? How's your research, son? I think we're near a breakthrough. Good work. Thanks, Dad. Oh, how I envy you. That back and forther you witnessed didn't happen overnight. It took years of effort. I've never been afraid of hard work. That's the spirit. Step one-- find an activity to share. Does the boy have any interests? What boy? Your son. Find something he likes and share in it. Well, he is building a soap box derby racer! Oh, that would be perfect. Dear God! Not again! Bart, I'm gonna help you build that racer. Thanks, but I'm almost done. Get back on the couch and watch TV. Okay. No! I'm gonna do it. Sorry, Dad, but three-time soap box derby champion Ronnie Beck... never needed his dad's help. But you can use me. I'm good. I built a lot of things around the house-- the spice rack... the bird feeder... the Gymboree. What was that? Ah, who cares? Son, please let me help you. Come on, Dad. It would be weird. This isn't working at all. It's hopeless. Wait a second. Hmm. "Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity. No matter what you tell your child to do... he will always do the opposite." Huh? Don't you get it? You gotta use reverse psychology. That sounds too complicated. Okay, don't use reverse psychology. All right, I will. Son, I don't think you should let me help you. If you really want to help, clean these paint brushes. Thank you, Bill Cosby. You've saved the Simpsons. You know, Marge, that Bart is a little miracle-- his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach... his face alight with wholesome mischief. He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit. Hmm, yeah. I like our chances, son. Ugh! Your father's not supposed to help build your racer... but you should at least consult him about it. D'oh! You're in heat four. Whoa. Where's your helmet? Helmets are for wusses. I can't let you go without a helmet. He's my son, and if he doesn't wanna wear one, you can't make him. Okay, fine. I wanna get out of here sometime today. Attention, everyone. To those questioning the value of the space program... behold! Ay, caramba! Hey... you can't smoke in the pit area. Fine. Hey, Simpson... where's your losermobile? Losermobile. Wait a minute. Uh, it's over there, Nelson. Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap. I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy. Same here. Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper. Help! Help! What was that? You didn't hear nothing! You nervous, son? Don't worry, Dad. As three-time soap box derby champion Ronnie Beck says... "Gravity is my copilot." Hey, boss. Just in case you need it. Ahh, thanks, guys. Now get out of here! Oh, I didn't realize this hill was so high. Could I have another-- Deploy, damn you! Deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow! Mm-hmm. Young man, this stress fracture... will require you to be in a cast for six weeks. That means I can't possibly race. You're lucky to be alive. Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor. Is it okay to visit? Of course. Hey, man, cool crash. Way to cheat death. Thanks, Bart. You had the best stick there. I wish I could build 'em like you. That racer transformed me into the twisted creature... you see before you. I'll never race again. If you don't race, Nelson will win. Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless-- Bart, will you drive my car? I don't know if I should. My dad and I built our car together. If I drove someone else's, it'd kill him. On the other hand, I'll do it. We've got a lot of work to do on the car. I'm pulling you out of school for two weeks-- I don't know how to say this, but I don't wanna drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart. The car has a few bugs, but we're Team Simpson. Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win. When did I teach you that? I picked it up somewhere. If I drive Martin's car, I can win. I'm sorry, but-- No, go ahead, leave me. Dad-- Go on and win. Go on and win without your dad. I'll just sit here in Li'l Lightnin' which the Simpsons built... and remember that for one brief shining moment... I had a son. Ow. Ohh! Dad. Can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's? Why? What's wrong? I scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little a**l but barefoot season's coming up... and there's a world of rusty nails out there. Sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you... then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa? D'oh! Martin, your bone is healing nicely. Tell me something I don't know. Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a-- You! Home wrecker! Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you. You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies. Dad, aren't you coming? No. Now, don't pout. I'm not pouting. You are. You gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge. Sorry. Don't you have something to say to Bart? [ Homer] No. Can't think of a thing. I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down. That's for sure. She ain't lying. But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father. Leave me alone. Good morning, everybody... and welcome to an event that harkens back... to the carefree days of the Great Depression-- the soap box derby. In just minutes these junior Al Unser,Jrs... will lock horns. Huh? "Name your son's hobbies." Building a soap box racer. "Name one of your child's friends." Martin. Martin! I'll curse that name till the day I die! Huh? "Who is your son's hero?" Three-time soap box derby champion, Ronnie Beck. Wow. I'm one question away from being a perfect father. "Name another dad you talk to about parenting." Ohh! Hey-hey-ho, Simpson. Shut up, Flanders. Flanders! Flanders! Flanders. Uh-- Uh-- When should a boy start dating? There are two schools of thought on the subject-- Great! Thanks! I talked to Flanders about parenting! I'm a perfect father! Hold on, son. I'm a-comin'. My friend and I have a bet. Are you Mary Tyler Moore? Ooh! Wow! It really is you. If she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands... or you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. What did I just tell you? Kill spectators. What is the matter with you? It's my dad-- lying there on the couch... drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that. Forget about your father! You're driving for me now. Do it for your old man, boy. Simpson, prepare to die. Let's rock. Ladies and gentlemen... to drop the green flag-- our beloved mayor... Diamond Joe Quimby. To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor. Check out the rack on the blond in the fourth row. Go! Go! Go! Go! Ha! Ha! Like the elegant Roman in Judah Ben-Hur... these modern charioteers battle ferociously. No quarter given; none asked. The world has not seen the likes of this... since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders... from Le Bourget Field. And now, to present the trophy... three-time soap box derby champion, Ronnie Beck. Congratulations, Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories. Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there... but someone was riding with me in spirit. This is for you, Dad. No, son, you earned it. I might remind you both I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast. The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive. Thanks, Nelson. Put her there. ♪ Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha ♪ Loser! ♪ Na-na, na-na-na ♪ You know, there is such a thing as being a bad winner. Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. ♪ Na-na, na-na-na ♪ That's my boy. ♪ Na-na, na-na-na ♪ ♪ Na-na, na-na-na ♪ Shh!
#03x10 - Flaming Moe's^Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and this is Eye on Springfield. [ Rock And Roll Instrumental Theme Playing ] Wow. Info-tainment. Tonight we salute the silver anniversary of the Great Springfield Tire Yard Fire. 25 years and still burning strong. We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man. He's not so fat. And we visit with heavyweight champion Dredrick Tatum who reminisces about growing up in Springfield. It was a dump. If you see me there, you know I up bad. But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at the bikini. Whoa-- T and A! Why are you still up? Lisa's slumber party. Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? They've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego. Lisa, your brother is so gross. You should smell his room. Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes that's what your husband's job will be. It's a mop. My husband will be a janitor. That looks like an Olympic torch to me. He could be an athlete and go on to have a great acting career. It's a dustpan. The wax never lies. Let's play truth or dare. Truth or dare! Truth or dare! I'll take... dare. I dare you to... kiss Lisa's brother. Eww!! What the..? Aaaaahh! I'm telling mom and dad. Who? Mom and dad. Jinx! ♪ You can't talk till somebody says your name ♪ Coming up next: An elephant who never forgets... to brush! What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man. Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? Because I'm jinxed, damn it!... Ow! What was that for? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you. Sorry, it's the law. There he is. Let's give him a makeover. Run for it, boy! Get him! Get him! Get him! Aaaaahh! Oof!. Come here, Maggie. Huh?! That's it, I'm out of here. Hiya, Homer. What's the matter, Moe? Oh, business is slow. People are healthier and drinking less. If it wasn't for the junior high school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine. Yeah, things are tough. Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants. Got a beer? Yeah, sure. Oh, sorry. I forgot we're out of beer. Aahh! I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the love tester. You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad. Ohh! Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at bartender's school. Gin and... tonic? Do they mix? Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself. One night, Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their vacation. And this is Patty trying to plug her razor into those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets. As you can see, we never got the hang of it. Ay, caramba! As I stared at that hairy drumstick I knew I needed a drink. Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? If you're going for a beer, this is the last one. D'oh! I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle. In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids'cough syrup. It passed the first test-- I didn't go blind. They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea but Selma sank right to the bottom. Huh?! I don't know the scientific explanation but fire made it good. Sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it? A Flaming Homer. Why don't you make us up a couple of Flaming Homers? You got any cough syrup? Let me check the lost and found. Bowie knife, troll doll... glass eye... Oh, here we are. It's not without it's charm. Try lighting it on fire. Hmm?! Wow! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. Hey, your love tester's busted. I want my nickel back. Hey, buddy, have one on the house. Hey, this drink is delicious and my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it? It's called a Flaming... Moe! It's called a Flaming Moe. That's right, a Flaming Moe. My name is Moe, and I invented it. What are you looking at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe. Oh! Oh! Hey, what's this? A sneeze guard. Wow, it really works! It hasn't been this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Think my drink had something to do with it? Who can say? It's probably a combination of things. Another pitcher of Flaming Moes. I hate this joint, but I love that drink. Ohhh. I couldn't help noticing your sign. You mean, " Bartenders Do it 'Til You Barf"? Above that store-bought drollery. Why don't we fill out an application. I'll need your name, measurements, and turn-ons. You expect me to tell you that? You could, but I find this way is much more accurate, and fun. Ugh! What salary do you offer? Minimum wage and tips. Of course, there are fringe benefits. Such as? An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe. I'd prefer to vacation someplace hot. Whoo! Ha-ha! Ow! Whoo! I like your moxie, kid. You're hired. You shan't regret this. Methinks I shan't. Are you the genius behind the Flaming Moe? Yes, I... I'm your man. I work for Tipsy McStagger's good time drinking and eating emporium. Oh, yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like? Tipsy McStagger is just a composite of other successful logos. You tell him for me that he makes one great mozzarella stick. Yes, I will. I've got a proposition for you. Your Flaming Moe is perfect for our chain. We want to buy the recipe. It's not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink? Uh... figure of speech. Sorry, Harv. I'll be back. Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million-dollar idea like that. Ohhh. The next time you use a gas chromatograph remember to thank Mr. A.J.P. Martin. Brilliant, Martin. Once again you've wrecked the grading curve. I pity the student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson, you're next. "The Inventor I Admire" by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is not a rich man or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson creator of... ♪ Dun-da-da-dah ♪ The Flaming Homer! The Flaming Homer? You mean the Flaming Moe and your dad didn't invent it, you wuss. Moe the bartender did. Everyone knows that. It's not true. My father invented it. Allow me to demonstrate. Are those liquor bottles? I brought plenty. Take those to the teachers' lounge. Hey, Bernard! Good evening, Krusty. Nice to see you, Bernard. Thank you very much. Krusty, over here! Krusty, one more! Henceforth, this date shall forever be known as Flaming Moe's Day. Sir, this is Veteran's Day. It can be two things. Mom, instead of milk, can I have a virgin Moe? Honey, what's wrong? I'll tell you what. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe I gave him. Take that off this second. Okay. Homey, why don't you go to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd share some of his success with you. Nah. Marge, I'm too upset to eat. I think I'll go to Moe's. D'oh! Oh! Hey! Can I help you? I need to see Moe. Your name's not on the list. I never gave it. What is it? Homer Simpson. Not on the list. We're all filled up. File off!. Some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get them to come up here. How about a warm Flaming Moe's welcome for... Aerosmith! Nah. We're just hanging out. Come on. Free pickled eggs. All right! Yeah! Hello, St. Louis! That's Springfield, Steven. Oh, yeah. Right. Are you ready to rock? Yeah! I said, are you ready to rock! Yeah! Hit it! Barney? Hi, Homer. I want you to meet my friends Armando and Raffi. Hey, Moe, come on. Get up here. Do you want to ignite my drink? You're my kid's teacher. Single parent, are we? No. Let's pretend you are. Get away from me. Hey, Moe! Homer, how about a beer? I'd rather have a Flaming Homer. A what? Oh, I get it. How could you do this to me? This bar was going under, and my drink saved it. My face should be on that crappy merchandise. Morris, is what this man says true? It's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe but I came up with the idea of charging 6.95. Uhp-- telephone. Flaming Moe's. I'm looking for a friend. Last name:Jazz. First name: Hugh. Hold on. I'll check. Huge ass? Somebody check the men's room for a huge ass. I'm Hugh Jazz. Telephone. This is Hugh Jazz. Uh... hi. Who's this? Bart Simpson. What can I do for you? This is a crank call that backfired and I'd like to bail out right now. Better luck next time. Hmm, what a nice young man. I'm sorry you're mad, but this isn't personal. This is business. Business, eh? Well, you just lost yourself a customer. What? I couldn't hear you. I said, you just lost a customer! What? You just lost a customer! You'll have to speak up. You lost yourself a customer, Moe! I forced myself to what? You just lost a customer! We'll talk tomorrow. You just lost yourself a customer! Yeah, you can use it. Barney! How's the world treating you? Hey, there! What can I do for you, Harv? Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink. He's here? No. My company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe. We're prepared to offer you $1 million. Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before it ain't for sale. Don't be stupid! We have a lab for this. We've figured it out, except for one ingredient. Brace yourselves, gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph the secret ingredient is... love?! Who's been screwing with this thing? I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me. 30 cases of cough syrup. Sign here. I got hooked on this in the service. Ah! My new watering hole. Yeah, what do you want?! A beer. Okay, then. Can I have a clean glass? Here you go, Your Majesty. Next on Eye on Springfield a toast to Moe, wizard of Walnut Street. The Flaming Moe dates back to my forefathers who were bartenders to the czar. So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case? I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson but you can't copyright a drink. Ohh! This goes back to the '7 8 Frank Wallbanger case. How about that? I looked something up. These books don't just make the office look good. They're filled with useful legal tidbits. Stupid Moe. Non-inventing, recipe-stealing, pug-nosed... maybe you can take consolation in that something you created I'm the magical man from happy land in a gumdrop house on lollipop lane. Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Well, duh! Now, that's what I call a happy hour. Morris, something troubles me. My mother won't be home for another 20 minutes. No. I was thinking about Homer Simpson. That's okay. I was thinking about Sybil Danning. I meant, I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer. But, honey... He's your friend, Morris and you took advantage of him. All right. All right. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph! I sleep with a chick once it costs me half a million bananas. Moe, Moe, Moe... Bart, are you going to mow the lawn today? Okay, but you promised me Moe money. I Moe, I Moe. Moe, Moe, Moe... When Bart's done, can we Moe to the Moevies for the Moetinee? Of course. All work and Moe play makes Moe a Moe Moe. Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe? Moe Moe Moe. Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe. Moe Moe Moe Moe. Moe. Moe, Moe... Moe... Moe, Moe... Moe.... Moe, Moe... Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Aaaaahh! Hey, Homer. Hey, Homer. Hiya, Homer! What's the matter? Aaaaaaahhh! Hey, where's Joey? [Joey ] Mrs. Krabappel I really need my drumsticks. Come and get 'em! You're going to be a rich man, Moe. The way we usually work is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business. Ah, c'est la vie. What the..? Fools! You poor, pathetic misguided creatures choking down Flaming Moes all the time wondering, " How does he do it?" Well, I'm going to tell you. Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! The secret ingredient is... Homer, no! ...Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over-the-counter children's cough syrup. Shoot. Thank you, Mr. Nutball. Got to go, Moe. Tough luck. Aaaaaaaahhh! Holy cow, you just fell on Aerosmith! Hey, Homer. Come in here. Hi, Moe. Where's your waitress? She left to pursue a movie career. Frankly, I think she was better off here. Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret. I guess so. Compliments of the house-- One Flaming... Homer. Aw, thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have. Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight? I doubt it. Shh!
#03x11 - Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk^It's formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits. Hot dog. And mild enough to use daily. Isn't life grand? What's wrong, sir? Did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said, "No more tears." A lovely promise... but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo. There's something you're not telling me. Perhaps you'd talk to Snappy the alligator? Maybe. Hello, Mr. Burns. Snappy, it's hard to imagine... but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam home runs... and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen. There's still time for that. Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress. So you feel resentful towards the plant. Yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl. Mmm!... Hmm?! D'oh! Ohh, what do they want? Maybe a nap will boost my spirits. I'll get that whale song cassette you like, sir. Oh, it's not fair! I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed. People think because he's rich and powerful and cruel... he doesn't have feelings, but he does. I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for $1 00 million. Ooh, that's a lot of money. D'oh! Uh... Mr. Smithers... do you have change for a dollar? Good, good-- try to eat something. Homer Simpson here. It's your stockbroker. Your stock in the plant... just went up for the first time in ten years. I own stock? All employees got some... in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights. So, how much did it go up? The book says to make small talk... before getting down to business. Everybody alive? Yeah. Like any sports? Sure. Ever go dancing? Not anymore. We should get together sometime. That'd be great. There. Now we trust each other. Well, how are you? Near death! I renew my notary license on a weekly basis. So what's my stock up to? Let me punch that up on the computer. Uh... 25¢ a share. What should I do? Let me put it this way-- you'll get $25 if you sell now. Sell! Sell! Sell! Whoo-hoo! Twenty-five dollars! Ooh! Mmm... hot wax. Oh, hammer. ♪ ...Fight, fight, fight fight, fight, fight ♪ ♪ The Itchy & Scratchy Show ♪ Mmm. Bart, turn to the Financial Channel. Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing. Unconfirmed takeover rumors... have pushed Burns Worldwide from I /8 to 52 and a quarter. Your father's stock is worth $5,200! Wow! 5,200 smackers! Oooh! Ahhh... Hey, Homer. Want a Duff? No, I'd like a bottle... of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve. Are you sure? 'Cause once I open the bottle, there's no refund. For your information... I just made a cool $25 playing the market. Buy low, sell high-- that's my motto. I may quit my job at the power plant... and become a full-time... stock market guy. Have a Duff, boys! Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you... your beer is like swill to us. Only a swine would drink this beer. Thank you, anyway. You aren't from around here, are you? We are from Germany. He is from the east; I am from the west. I had a big company, he had a big company. Now we have a very big company. We want to buy the power plant. Would your owner ever sell it? Well, I happen to know he won't sell it... for less than $1 00,000,000. 1 00,000,000? Ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf... Oh, don't worry. We'll have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns. It's the miracle... we've been waiting for. What are we spending it on? Homer's probably buying some magic beans with it. We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on. Hey, hey! Oh, Homer! You heard? We heard. Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money. I'm afraid I had some great plans too. What do you mean? I spent it on beer. Surprise, surprise. You spent $5,200 on beer?! $5,200? What are you talking about? What? I sold it all for 25 bucks! Oww! Come on, everybody. It makes you feel better. Hey, Homer. Did you buy this car with your stock money? Sure did, and the great thing about it... is everybody got rich. For once us working stiffs got a break. Wait till you see Lenny. He just got back from the plastic surgeon. Lenny, looks like you got the works. It started as an eye tuck, but the stock kept climbing. Come here. Mr. Burns is on TV. Mr. Burns? Here, Mr. Burns. Over here. Mr. Burns. We've heard a German consortium offered to purchase the plant. Any comments? You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen... before you'll see Germans running my plant! Then why are you meeting with them? So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle... and say, "Nein.!" You never cease to amaze me, sir. Hmm? Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! I grudgingly accept. Now, don't worry. You'll find these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie. Hans and Fritz-- Why, that's justJohn and Frank. Ich bin ein Springfielder. They'll bring their own people in. This ain't good. We could all lose our jobs. Look at all those worried faces... except for Lenny. He looks great. This is the worst day of my life. Those Germans can't fire me. I'm the only one who can unjam the rod dissociator. They can't fire me. I run the gaseous contaminant particularifier. They can't fire me. Why? Why? 'Cause... Guten morgen. I am Horst. I'm speaking with you... because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of lovable Sergeant Schultz... on Hogan's Heroes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he does. What is the best way... to an efficient plant? I don't know. Well, uh... Search me. Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs-- So let's get to know each other better. Do we have any alcoholics among us? Uh... me. Right here. I'm drunk right now. You'll be given a six-week treatment... at our drying-out facility in Hawaii... after which you'll return at full pay. Oh, great! Great. Hey, maybe I'll marry Elizabeth Taylor. Lucky drunks. We cannot uber-emphasize... the importance of employee safety. We plan to have some frank discussions... with your safety inspector. Yeah, sock it to 'em, Horst! Psst. Hey, Homer. Aren't you the safety inspector? D'oh! Mm-hmm-hmm... mm-hmm... That's one big check. You look sharp today, sir. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr. That was a gutsy decision, sir. Smithers, come here. I wanted to give you something... and I know you wanted this photo... of Elvis and me. He was good to his mother. Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said. "Mr. Burns... hound dog." Stop it. You're killing me, sir. Sir, what will you do next? I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Beekeeping? Boxing? Bocce ball? The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell. Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany? Well, it's a country in Europe. Good. I'm learning. An economic power of the world. Because we send them money? No. They're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic. D'oh! Oh, woe is me. Homie, come to bed. Oh, Marge, I'm going to be fired. I know it. Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow. Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety "whatchamajigger," I"m nothing. Well, if you can't sleep... why don't you do something constructive? Ooh... Battlestar Galactica.! Fit, damn you! Fit! There. Yo, Homer, you got to get ready for work. Uh-huh. What? What am I gonna-- Hey, you! Stop being... so unsafe! Smitty... safen up. Could we have a word? No. I must have phrased that badly. My English is inelegant. I meant to say... may we have a brief, friendly chat? No. Failed again. "We request the pleasure of your company... for a free exchange of ideas." Nooo! You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded? Uh... all of them? I see. Then you must have some good ideas... for the future as well. I sure do! Such as? Well, uh... I wish the candy machine... wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because... a lot of workers really like candy. We understand, Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate. Wow... chocolate, half-price! ♪ La la la-la-la-la-la ♪ Mr. Simpson. ♪ La-la-la-la-la ♪ Mr. Simpson? Huh? Oh, sorry. We were talking about chocolate? That was ten minutes ago. I think I did pretty good in there. Yeah, those Germans aren't so bad. Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers. Attention, workers. We have completed our evaluation. We regret to announce the following layoffs... which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all. Ay, caramba.! Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair. And we saved $40 for the family. We all have to pull together till your father gets a new job. I made some soap by squeezing soap slivers together. That's very clever. Instead of buying comic books, I read them in the store. You shouldn't do that. My jump rope broke, but I tied it together. Good, Lisa. I didn't take a bath today and may not take one tomorrow. I want you to take baths, Bart. Lousy German know-it-alls. Who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh, what's the matter with this thing? No problems here. That's right, Burnsie. Keep your wrist supple. Throw it, don't aim it. This is my park. Get out! It was worth it. This place has gone to hell. It's obscene what they did to your office. You caught me at a bad time. But my folk guitar class has been canceled. Would you like to get together for a drink? Would I?! I got to go. See you at 6:00. You're going down, my friend. Yes, sir, Mr. Burns. That shouldn't be. Ach du lieber.! Raccoons! That's right. Gather the nectar, my little drones... and make the honey-- honey for your children. Fools! Ready for that drink, sir? Just a second. Let me introduce you to the gang. That's Buzz, that's Honey. And you see that queen? Her name is Smithers. That's very flattering, but we should go. Several bees are stinging me. Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking. I'm looking... for a Mrs. O'Problem, first name: Bea. Uh...just a minute, I'll check. Uh... Bea O'Problem? Bea O'Problem? Come on, guys. Do I have a Bea O'Problem here? You sure do. Oh! It's you, isn't it? When I get you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket... and paint my house with your brains. Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home. Excuse me. I'm looking for... Wait a minute. I know that voice. If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years. That's right. That's my pop. Oh, little Bart. We hear all about your monkeyshines. Bet you get into all kinds of trouble... he don't even know about. Am I right? Well, I make some crank phone calls. Aw, ha-ha, that's great! Ha-ha-ha! Hey, would you sing that old song... you used to sing for me? Moe, for you, anything. Look.! A blue-collar bar. Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming. Encore! He's a pip, this one is. Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers. We're going in. Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer... for me and my buddy here. I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile. Smithers, who is this saucy fellow? Homer Simpson. Sector sieben-gruben-- I mean, sector 7-G. Recently terminated. I lost my job... so you could have another $1 00 million! Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue? Yes. Bad example. Let me ask you this: Does your money ever hug you... when you come home at night? Why, no. And does it ever say "I love you"? No, it doesn't. ♪ Nobody loves you ♪ ♪ Nobody loves you ♪ ♪ You're old and you're ugly ♪ Way to go, Homer! Good heavens, Smithers. They're not afraid of me anymore. Hey, Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent? Letter? I don't recall-- That's because I forgot to stamp it! Ah, that kid slays me. That was no accident. Let's get out of here. ♪ Na na nah nah ♪ ♪ Na na nah nah ♪ ♪ Wa-a-ave ♪ ♪ Good-bye ♪ What good is money... if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back. Gott in himmel.! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a death trap? It will cost another I 00 million just to bring it up to code. Please sell me my plant back. I'll pay anything. What a happy coincidence! You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell. Desperate, eh? Advantage: Burns. This is my offer. You'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks. But this is half of what we paid you. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it. All right, Mr. Burns, you win. But beware-- we Germans aren't all smiles und sunshine. Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans! Stop it. Stop that. The Germans are coming after me. Stop the pretending you are scared game. They're so big. Stop it, Mr. Burns. Protect me from the Germans! Stop it! Get out! This is my office now! Get out! You too! This is a place of business, not a peewee flophouse! Your orders, sir. Restore my office, cancel all repairs... and rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar. Homer Simpson? But why? Smithers, I keep my friends close... and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence... as the months and years drift by... blissfully unaware... that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head. Whoo-hoo! I got my job back! 
#03x12 - I Married Marge^"Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test"? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand? But, Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe. Okay, let's see. "Ahoy, mateys. If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be." Well, what color is it-- blue or purple? Pink. D'oh! "If a test should fail... to a doctor set sail." I guess I better go see Dr. Hibbert. Oh, honey... do you really think you're pregnant? I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix... I did with the other kids. And I have the same tightness in my chest... and profuse sweating I always get. I'll let you know. Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor? Is anything wrong? Everything's fine. Your mother, uh... just broke her leg. I smell a bun in the oven. Is Mom going to have another baby, Dad? Maybe. Whoa! Hey, all right! Way to go! You're a machine, Homer. Did you hear that, Maggie? Another baby in the house. Oh, cool. We can race 'em. Sure, for you, a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings. Doesn't Mom do that? Yeah, but I hear about it. Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me? I threw up more than your mother. It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade... known as the '80s. Those were idealistic days-- The candidacy ofJohn Anderson, the rise of Supertramp. It was an exciting time to be young. For several years I'd been dating your mother... and working at the local fun center. Homer, you turn the blades too fast. The golfers are complaining. Slow down! That's better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up... and someday you'll be the guy... who hands out the putters. Yes, sir! I was 2 4 years old... with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future. You're supposed to be listening... to my story! I thought it was over. You had a problem turning blades. You overcame it. The feel-good story of the year. It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans. We watch an appalling amount ofTV. Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. You lousy, ungrateful... can't-keep-their, what-do-you-call-it... minds-on-any, uh... Okay, girls, you can smoke now. Mmm. Oh, yeah. It's Homer! I don't know what you see... in that ugly meatball. Uh-huh. If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy... we could get a cat. It would leave less hair on the couch. You don't know Homer like I do. He's sensitive and sweet. Marge, get your butt out here.! Mmm. Homer, do you ever think about the future? You mean like will apes be our masters? No, how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is stimulating. It gives me time to think. What do you think about? Well, girls. I mean boys! I mean you. I think about you too. Wow, what an ending. Who would have thought... Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father? Well, thank you, Mr. Blow-The-Picture-For-Me. Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia... and as smart as Yoda. Oh, Homer. Mmm. Mmm. I bet the guy she was singing that about... was real happy. Actually, she was singing about God. Oh, well, he's always happy. No, wait, he's always mad. Someday I'll buy you a real castle. You don't have to do that. Whoo, good. Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking... but I think you're pretty sexy. Really? It must be the Champale talking. Oh, Homer, what if we get caught? Don't worry. This castle is impregnable. Pass the cookie dough. Dust off your hula skirts, angels. There's been a murder in Hawaii. Hawaii, it is, Charlie. Hello? Oh, hi, Marge. I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer. Why, what's wrong? Well... that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club. Oh. Well, Miss Bouvier... we found the reason... why you've been throwing up in the morning. Congratulations. D'oh! Poor guy. Perhaps this pamphlet will prove helpful. "So You've Ruined Your Life." Mmm. Son, you've got to marry that girl. Because it's honorable? No! Because you'll never do any better. You lucky bum. The fish jumped right in the boat. All you got to do is whack her with the oar. Marge, there's something I want to ask you... but I'm afraid because if you say "no"... it'll destroy me and make me a criminal. I haven't said "no" to you lately. Marge, I-- Damn it, where's that card? What card? I wrote down what I was going to say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket. Is this it? What's it say? "Marge, from the first moment I saw you... I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you except all my love. Will you marry me?" That's the card. Oh, Homer... this is the most beautiful moment of my life. So, will you marry me? Yes! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, she's going to marry me! In your face, everybody! Whoo-hoo! If the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel? The baby's name will be Kool Moe Dee Simpson. Ariel. Kool Moe Dee. Ariel. Kool Moe Dee. You know, I had this very same discussion... with your mother ten years ago. If the baby's a boy... what do you think of the name Larry? We can't do that. All the kids will call him Larry Fairy. Well, how about Louis? They'll call him Screwy Louie. Bob? Slob. Luke? Puke. Marcus? Mucus. What about Bart? Let's see. Bart, cart, dart, e-art-- Nope. Can't see any problem with that. Wow. I'll take that ring. And how will you be paying for it? I don't know. Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money... so we went to a quaint little chapel... just across the state line. Basic ceremony is 20 bucks. Here's your license. Get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house. This marriage is gonna last forever. No matter how many times I hear that... it always makes me laugh. Cletus, do you take Aileen to be your lawful wedded wife? Yup. Done. Next. There certainly are... a lot of stains on the ceiling. Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place. Homer, I'd be lying if I said... that this is how I pictured my wedding day... but you are how I pictured my husband. I am? You may not look like Ted Bessell... but you're just as nice. Ohhh. We are gathered here in the sight of God... and this casino to join-- Homer. And-- Marge. In holy matrimony. Beautiful. Do you, Marjorie Bouvier, take Homer Simpson... to be your lawful wedded husband? I do. Homer, same question, names reversed. I do. By the power vested in me by the state gaming commission... I pronounce you man and wife. Here's $1 0 worth of chips. You may kiss the bride. Next.! Mmm. What a perfect day. Our first night together as man and wife. Mmm. Hey, love birds, keep it down. Look what I got, Marge. A baby monitor. Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over. I don't know how we can afford these things... on your salary. Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well. I heard radiation can make you sterile. Now you tell me. We only have two openings... so one of you will go home empty-handed. But it won't be my old frat buddy... Lou Collier. How you doing, you old Alpha Tau? Smithers, you keg-meister, you. Uh-huh-huh, hey. Uh-huh-huh, hey. Well, hey, I'm from the Alabama chapter. Well, I'll be. Let's get on with the testing. If I didn't know better, I'd swear... he was trying to moon us. What would you say is your worst quality? I am a workaholic. I push myself too hard. It takes me a long time to learn anything. I'm kind of a goof-off-- That will do. Stuff starts disappearing-- That's enough. There's a problem with the reactor. What do you do? A problem with the reactor?! We're all going to die! Run! Mmm... mmm. Did you get the job? Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life. Oh, Homey. Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking. Wow. Kid, I won't let you down. When you come out of there... the first thing you're going to see... is a man with a good job. Yeah. The doctor. ...and when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold. What a crappy candle. You've ruined our vacation. You, gentle sir, are fired. Oh! Oh, hello, young man. Good evening, madam. You have been selected by Slash-Co... to reap the benefits... of their new Never-Dull knife edge. Here. Shake hands with the Slash-Co. Handle first, handle first. Hmm. I quit! I quit! I thought you said you liked dogs. Hey! Who wants to get rich today? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first. Let me assure you... that this is not one of those shady pyramid schemes... you've been hearing about. Our model is the trapezoid... that guarantees each investor an 800% return... within hours of your initial-- Uh-oh! The cops! "Fourth notice." "90 days overdue." "We break thumbs." Homer, what are we going to do? I don't know. I don't know. Repo man. I'm here for the baby's things. Crib, mobile, monitor... and the lady's ring, I'm afraid. Oh, dear. Repossessing stuff... is the hardest part of my job. Dear Marge. By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things... and although I can give them to you... they will be repossessed... and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear... that your family doesn't want me here. Shut up with that pen scratching down there. I will send you every cent I earn... for the baby... but you will not see me again until I am a man. That is so sad. Oh, come on, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today... if I hadn't become... the responsible head of a household. Can we have a can of frosting for lunch? Okay. "You will not see me again... until I am a man." Oh, Homer... Homer! We're all in shock. I thought he'd two-time you for a while first. This taco is full of hair. Uh-huh. There's your explanation. Shall we tell Marge? Let her read about it in the society page. Homer?! Oh. Marge, listen, we just saw-- Don't be stupid. Dear Marge, X-X-X-- Homer. Big shots... with their stainless steel lunch boxes. They get doughnuts! That's right. All the colors of the rainbow. Wow. Marge, what are you doing up? You need rest. I heard a noise outside, and thought it might be Homer. Ay! What the hell. Marge, I've got 2½/ words for you. Gulp 'n' Blow. Yeah, what do you want? My husband by my side. You want fries with that? Homer?! Marge?! Homer! Marge! Holy cow, you're as big as a house! Homer, come home with me. No, Marge, I can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a trainee. They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. And I can't buy you a decent wedding ring. Any ring is fine, as long as it's from you. Marge... pour vous. Oh! Would you mind if I took it off? The oil is burning my finger. Oh, sure. Homer, do you know why I married you? I knocked you up. No, because I love you. Come home soon. That's it. Come closer. Ironic, isn't it? The hunter has become the hunted. Oh, God, Smithers... I feel so alive! You the boss? Yes. I'll call Security. Listen, Mr. Big Shot... if you're looking for the kind of employee... who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man! Treat me like dirt-- I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream! If you don't like it, I can change! Hold the phone, Smithers. I like your attitude. Feisty, yet spineless. This man failed the aptitude test... and got trapped in a closet on his way out. I don't care. I haven't been this impressed... since I first laid eyes on a young bootlick named Waylon Smithers. You mean...? Welcome aboard, son. I got the job. I got the job! Whoo-hoo! Only in America could I get a job! Who was that young hellcat? Homer Simpson. Simpson, eh? I'll remember that name. Marge, Marge! You're a little late. She's gone to the hospital. The hospital?! I'll drive you. Thanks, Mom. Don't ever call me that. Where's the baby? Where you left it. Shut up. Listen, fat boy-- No, you listen. This is my wife, and my kid. I'm paying for this delivery. If you wanna stay... you give me some respect. Homer, does this mean...? Tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician! Good God! Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back. Doesn't your job start tomorrow? Somebody will cover for me. Homer, that's... Oh! Step aside. I'll deliver this baby. Why don't you let me handle it? Oh, a college boy, eh? Homer, let him deliver the baby! Homey, isn't he beautiful? As long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes... he's fine by me. Oh, Bart! Daddy's little angel. Ah! Why, you little...! He did that on purpose! How could he? He's only ten minutes old. Bart, Lisa, come here for a minute. You know, son, the day you were born... I received the greatest gift... a man could have. As the years went by... your mother and I were blessed twice more... and not a day goes by we don't thank God for all three of you. Homer! I'm not pregnant! Yeah! Whoa! Excellent, Marge! Yes!
#03x13 - Radio Bart^Oh, ain't that cute? Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... dancing? Whoa. Ooh. Oh, yeah. Can I have money... to buy Bart a birthday present? Money. Dad, this is $1 I 0. Oh. Sorry. That's righteous. Funky See, Funky Do will be back to lip-synch one of their hits... right after this. Hey, kids, why sit in front of the TV... when you can be on the radio? ♪ We're gonna roll this truckin' convoy ♪ ♪ Across the U.S.A. ♪ ♪ Convoy ♪ That could be Bart. Throw away your bulky transmitters... and broadcasting towers. The superstar celebrity microphone... lets you hear your voice through any A.M. radio. Hey, good-looking... we'll be back to pick you up later. He's in for some loving. It's the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations... board meetings. You're fired. Bart's birthday's coming up. But order now, supply is limited. Limited! Do you have any of those microphones left? Yeah, a couple. Bart's really going to like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees... I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet. Mmm, yeah. Okay, Sideshow Mel... bring out the birthday cake. Hey, kids... while Sideshow Mel mops up... let's see the names... of our Krusty birthday pals for today. All right, here comes my name. Wow. Best eight bucks I ever spent. Bart, your grandpa's on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday. Isn't that nice? Take a message. Right now, I'm off to hit 46 local merchants... for free birthday... goods and services. I'm here for my free birthday sundae. Eat it and get out. Digital audiotape, my butt. When I was a kid, we had compact discs... and I don't recall no one complaining. Damn right. Sorry, Rosarita. I got to get to my birthday party. Farewell, Señor Bart. Hey, good to see you. Glad you could make it. Toby, have you lost weight? Uh-oh, here comes trouble. It's Wally! Hey, Wally, do something funny. Hey, later, okay? Hey, why don't you go bug your parents? Cool, Larry the Looter. All right, stick it to the man. Hey there. I hear it's your birthday. How old are you? Well, I'm-- That's great. Would you like us to sing you a special song? Hell, no. You got it. Ready, Señor Beaveratti? I'm a-ready. And a-one, and a-two... ♪ You're the birthday ♪ ♪ You're the birthday ♪ ♪ You're the birthday boy or girl... ♪ What the...? It's a label maker. We have one at home. Before we got it... I was always finding Patty's stubble... in my leg razor. Bart, I'll bet you think... nothing's going to top that cactus. Well, check out my present. Next. Bart, be polite. Next, please. Bart, I've noticed... your birthday presents are a poor crop at best. I hope this turns the tide. Ooh,just gorgeous. Now we can be twins. There's only one beer left, and it's Bart's. Hey, boy, how's the microphone working? Fine. Bart! I would love to get a present like that. Here you go. Enjoy. D'oh! This is a great invention. Watch. ♪ We got a great big convoy ♪ ♪ Rocking through the night ♪ ♪ We got a great big convoy ♪ ♪ Convoy ♪ Quit it, Dad! Hey, good-looking... we'll be back for some dinner later. What did you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion. What a crappy birthday. I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does. Testing. Testing one-two-three. Oh, my. Do I sound like that? Hey, it does work. I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father? Mmm, chocolate. D'oh! Mmm, chocolate. D'oh! Marge, we need some more... vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream. I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer. Mmm, chocolate. People of Earth, this is Bartron-- commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless. We have captured your president. He was delicious. Why, you little-- Oh... just promise me... you won't play any more practical jokes. I promise. Mama. Mama. Maggie, you talked! Can you say "Mama" again? Sorry, lady. Show's over. Oh, Bart. I dreamed I was married to Corey... and we lived on a pony farm... and Corey was always walking around... with his shirt off. Oh, brother. Mrs. Crabapple, that was uncalled for. Bravo! Well done, old man. Hmm. Rod, Tod, this is God. How did you get on the radio? What do you mean? I created the universe, stupid kids. Forgive my brother. We believe you. Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it... for you... later. What do you want? I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen... and leave them on the Simpsons' porch. But those belong to our parents. Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God? Happy God. Then quit flapping your lip. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Whoops. Help! Help! Sounds like trouble a-brewing at the old well! Help me, please. I fell down the well! I'll get help, laddie. A little nip of courage. Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse! Sucker. Huh? Hey, what's up? Some poor kid... fell down a well. Yes! My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old. Timmy, where are your parents? I have no family. I tried to enroll in school... but Principal Skinner turned me away... because of my shabby clothes. He's a liar. The circumference of the well is 34 inches. So, unfortunately... not one member of our police force... is slender enough to rescue the boy. By God, men, you're a bunch of marshmallows. Why don't you go, Chief? Well, I'm too... important. Timmy has told us... his foot is trapped under a rock. Any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig. In desperation, the city is considering... more unorthodox solutions. Grasping the child firmly in his talons... Socrates here will fly him to safety. Just watch. I don't think he's coming back. With this hook and this hunk of chocolate... I'll land your boy... and I'll clean him for free. Although we can't reach the boy... we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen... so that future generations can rescue him. Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty... we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole... trapped in that well. Bart, what's wrong with you? Yeah. Timmy is a real hero. How do you mean, Dad? Well, he fell down a well and can't get out. How does that make him a hero? Well, it's more than you did. Channel 6's own Krusty the Clown... has gathered members of the entertainment community-- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes-- for a video called... "We're Sending Our Love down the Well." I wanted to do something... to help... so I called my friend, Sting. He said... "When do you need me?" I said, "Thursday." He said, "I'm busy." I said, "Friday?" He said... "Friday's worse." Then he said, "How about Saturday?" I said, "Fine." True story. Yeah. I used to open for Krusty in '69. In fact, he fired me, as I recall. Oh, Sting. But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole... or something. We've gotta do what we can. ♪ There's a hole in my heart as deep as a well ♪ ♪ For that poor little boy who sunk halfway to hell ♪ ♪ Though we can't get him out we'll do the next best thing ♪ ♪ And go on TV and sing, sing, sing ♪ ♪ And we're sending our love down the well ♪ ♪ All the way down ♪ ♪ We're sending our love down the well ♪ ♪ Down that well ♪ Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties? We got to pay for promotion, shipping, distribution. You know, those limos out back aren't free. Whatever's left, we throw down the well. Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth. $6.00 a bag. Step to the rear. Plenty of room in the back. ♪ The Itchy and Scratchy Show ♪ Hmm? Hmm? Ah. Drop that microphone. Drop it, boy! This is a special report... from Channel 6 News. Disturbing news from the old well... where Timmy O'Toole... has apparently taken a turn for the worse. It's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral or wolf-like state. Here's an artist's conception. Bart. Ahem. I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but... I couldn't get through my sock. Good night, everybody. The thought of a boy trapped in a well... brought out the kindness of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them... they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors. And how are they going to find out? The police will catch you. The police couldn't catch a cold. Maybe not, but you're stupid enough... to have left a "Bart Simpson" label... on that radio. D'oh! "...and Cinderella had... the most beautiful gown at the ball... with eight satin petticoats... each more delicate than the last." I think he's asleep. Want a cup of coffee? Okay. Brave little guy. Hey. Almost tripped over this thing. Ugh! What did I do to deserve this? Help! I fell down the well. Tell us something we don't know. No, my name is Bart Simpson. What are you doing down there? Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody. Well, you sure fooled us, kid. Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home... and go to sleep. Good one, Eddie. Ha, ha. Great joke, guys. Guys? Your son... is trapped down the well. You must think we're the worst parents in the world. Yes, that's pretty much the feeling down at the station. Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped... doesn't mean you can't live a full life. I brought you your Krusty doll. Ow! Knock it off, you bald boob! Don't make me come down there! Like to see you fit. Why, you little...! Put a man on him. I like the other boy. So polite. What are you doing to save my baby boy? We've located a piece of machinery... in Louisiana... that could pop him out lickety-split. Why don't you get it? We've got a budget problem. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo. You're telling me the city won't pay... to get a boy out of a well? They would have for Timmy, but your son... he played us all for saps. Mmm. We've all been the victims of a cruel hoax... perpetrated by a ten-year-old hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing... and most of them are squarely aimed... at the boy's parents. It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy. He was an accident. Homer! Could you edit that last part? Mr. Simpson, we're live. D'oh! ♪ One plus one plus three is five ♪ ♪ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive ♪ ♪ He's so neat He's so sweet ♪ ♪ Now the rats have Bart to eat... ♪ Hey, stop that! Oh. Sorry, Lisa. ♪ How many days until Bart croaks? ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four... ♪ And our new number one hit "I Do Believe We're Naked" by Funky See, Funky Do... replaces "We're Sending Our Love down the Well," which plunges all the way down to number 97. Ever since I called for the rescue... of that Simpson lad, I have taken heat... so I am flip-flopping. I say let him stay down there. Yeah, Shutton here. Now, that's a story. Bart, honey, I made you an extra warm sweater... you can wear while you're down in the well. Mom, it's too big. You'll grow into it. Homer! I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. Now I'm paying the price... but there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do-- smoke a cigarette... use a fake I.D.... shave a swear word in my hair-- That's all I can stands. I can't stands no more. I'm going to get you out of there myself. Now, why didn't I think of that? Agnes, we've got work to do. This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin. The Lincoln squirrel has been assassinated. We'll stay with the story all night, if we have to. What's going on? It's an old-fashioned hole digging. By gar, it's been a while. The canary. Gas! Out of the hole! Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes. Back in the hole! Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest. Not while one of my fans needs me. Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play your albums. Shh! Marge, he's a good digger. Uhh! Sting! Mom! Dad! Bart, I've missed you so much. Man, I was so scared. Don't worry, son. They're going to make sure... no one ever falls down this well again. That should do it. 
#03x14 - Lisa the Greek^Bret Councilman here... on week eight of the N.F.L. season. Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action. Well, bye-bye belt. Homer, all those fatty... deep-fried, heavily-salted snacks... can't be good for your heart. My heart is just fine. A little beer will put out that fire. Now with the specs for today's games... the man who's right... 52% of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo. Our first game today, Denver and New England... is too close to call. Oh... But if you're the compulsive type... who just has to bet... Well, I don't know. Mmm... Denver! Woo-whoo! Denver! Yeah! Moe's Tavern... where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly. Moe, I'd like to bet $20 on Denver. I think I can provide that service. Chief Wiggum, could you hand me... that little black book? Sure thing, Moe. I was using it as a coaster. $20 on Denver. Pleasure doing business... H.S. All right, Denver, justify my love. At the end of I 3 seconds... it's New England seven, Denver nothing. D'oh! Look, Dad. I made an apartment... for my Malibu Stacy doll. This is a kitchen. This is where she prints her feminist newsletter. Dad, you're not listening to me! Lousy, stupid Denver. Mmm! Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever. Why isn't Dad interested... in anything I do? Do you ever take an interest in anything he does? No... Well, we used to have burping contests... but I outgrew it. If you want to get closer to him... maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in power tools... going to silly car-chase movies... and things I'll tell you when you're older. Do you understand? I think so. Bart! What? Oh, look at that. Why did you do that? Wouldn't it be fun... if we watched the game together? Uh... okay. Just don't say anything, and sit down over there. Over. Over. Over. Over. Lisa, I can't hear the announcer. He said Denver fumbled. D'oh! See you in hell, soldier boy. Bart? Yeah, Mom? While your father and Lisa watch the game... it might be fun if we went clothes shopping. Mom, I'd love to, but I don't need new clothes. Oh, really? Even though I'd love to spend... this sunny afternoon trying on clothes, it's not... Folks, when you're right 52% of the time... you're wrong 48% of the time. Why didn't you say that before?! Okay, you're off the hook. Any thoughts on Miami-Cincinnati? I certainly do, Bret. I hereby declare Miami... to be Smooth Jimmy's 'Lock of the Week.' Ooh, that's a big lock. I just don't trust that guy. In the Cincinnati-Miami game... I declare Cincinnati my 'Shoe-in of the Week.' They both make a good case. After evaluating millions of pieces of data... in the blink of an eye... the Gamble-Tron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati... by 200 points?! Why, you worthless hunk of junk! You want this, don't you? Yeah! You need the winners, and I know them. So call me now. $5 for the first minute, $2 for additional minutes. You... have reached... the Coach's... Hot... Line. line. Lay it on me, Coach. In the game of... Mi-am-i... Mm-hmm. versus Cin... Cincinnati. cin... Cincinnati. na... Cincinnati. ti... Come on! Don't you realize this is costing me money? we must consider... many things. The wind... D'oh, not the wind! is blowing out of the... west... at five... Miles per hour. knots. This is ridiculous! Lisa, who do you think will win-- the Bengals or the Dolphins? I don't know. The Dolphins? Good, good. Moe, $50 on the Miami Dolphins. 50 beans on Miami. Homer, I got a call on the other line. It's me, Mr. K. What will it be? Put me down for $7 00 on the Rams. Put Sideshow down for two grand. Mom, I'm tired. I want to go home. Can't I just lie down for a minute? Bart, I think you'd look very sharp... in this shirt. Fine. Get it. Let's go. No, no, no. You have to try it on. Ooh, this one's 50% off. That's because people who wear them get beaten up. Well, anyone who would do that isn't your friend. This looks good... and this one is very, very cute... and these... Oh, look, little bow ties! And don't make that face at me. How did you know? Touchdown, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! 50 big ones! 50 big ones? Uh-oh. Daddy's friend Moe promised... to give him $50 if the Dolphins won. You made a bet? I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing daddies do... to make football more exciting. What could be more exciting... than the savage ballet of pro football? Well, you know. You like ice cream, don't you? Don't you like ice cream better... when it's covered with hot fudge... and mounds of whipped cream, chopped nuts... and those crumbled-up cookie things they mash up? Mmm... crumbled-up cookie things. So gambling makes a good thing even better? That's right! My God... it's like there's some kind of bond between us. Hmm? Mm-hmm. We've got a troublemaker in booth eight. There's a code red in booth three. My God! Those aren't the socks... she came in with. Let's move. Bart? In here, Mom. Don't open... You could use some new underwear too. Look at that stupid kid! Three! Three! Two! Two! One! One! And the final from Riverfront Stadium: Miami 2 4, Cincinnati I 0. Yeah! Yeah! Mom sure will be happy you won $50. You'd think that... but your mother has this crazy idea... that gambling is wrong... even though they say it's okay in the Bible. Really? Where? Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is, we had a great time today. To keep it that way... let's not tell your mother about our little wager, okay? Okay, Dad. Did you two have fun? You bet. We had fun too. Bart is modeling his new clothes... for his friends. Ooh... You got to come out sometime, Simpson. Good night, Dad. I had a nice time today. Me too, honey. Can I watch football with you again next Sunday? Sure. It gets rid... of the unpleasant aftertaste of church. See how good things happen... if you make a little effort? Point well taken. Could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight, and it's cutting off... the circulation in my arms and legs. This team is fired up. All right! He'll lose. What? Didn't you hear what he said? The fear in his eyes, the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy lost in a game of men. Should we bet against them? I'd bet my entire college fund on it. Moe, $23 on New York. Start spreading the news. It's New York over Philadelphia, 3 5 to I 0. Yay! Yay! Dad, I hate to break the mood... but I'm getting nauseous. Oh, sorry. So, who do you like in the afternoon games? The 49ers because they're pure of heart... Seattle because they got something to prove... and the Raiders because they cheat. In an extremely suspicious play... the Raiders win! Three for three! Hey, the new sign's really working. It's been a madhouse, Lisa. Let's see... football... football... Homoeroticism in... Oddball Canadian Rules... Phyllis George in... Oh, doctor, what a finish! The final score-- Atlanta I 7, Houston I 3. The lowly Falcons are flying high. Who would have thunk it? My daughter, that's who. Yeah, me. You pick the winner every time. You must have some kind of special gift. It doesn't take a genius... to realize Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings... the week after scoring three touchdowns... in a game. My little girl says the cutest things. Dad, Sunday is fast becoming... my favorite day of the week. Not Sunday-- Daddy-Daughter Day. The usual, Moe-- a beer... and a wad of bills! Okay... you lucky moron. Here you go, Homer, $1 3 5. I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory. Oh, shut up. Look at these prices! We could finally get rid... of those termites for the cost of this meal. Tut-tut, only the best for my family. I wonder where you're getting the money. Can't a man do something nice for his loved ones? I guess so. Hello, I'm Marco, I'll be your waiter. I'm Homer, I'll be your customer. Never heard that one before. Would you care to select the wine? I'll do the honors. No, no, no, no. My God! What passes for a wine list these days? Just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop, chop. Charming lad. Oh, violin guy. What's your favorite song, Lisa? "The Broken Neck Blues." Play on. It is the play-offs. It's five below. One fan's wearing a G-string... and the team colors on his body. Maybe the paint has shut off his pores... and he's slowly suffocating. That is a real fan. It's Daddy-Daughter Day... and Daddy needs daughter's picks. The Chiefs are my five star, silver bullet special. With your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys... plus five at Chicago. You call Moe. Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S. Just bet, Lisa. 1 I 0, I 20... You lucky son of a... Want to go bowling Sunday? Are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that? Ma's coming in from Norway... but what the hell. When the doctor said... I didn't have worms anymore, that was the happiest day... of my life. Thank you, Ralph, very graphic. Lisa Simpson, would you like to read your essay? The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago... when the Saints-- four and a half point favorites... only up by three-- kicked a meaningless field goal... at the last second to cover the spread. Dear God! You must have bought me... every Malibu Stacy accessory. Not quite. They were out of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers. Ooh, perfume! "Meryl Streep's Versatility." I know you're going to like your present. Shut up! Shut up! Kiss my butt! Go to hell! Dad, I promise... I will never get tired of this. Those were very thoughtful presents... but you have to tell me where you got the money. You have to promise you won't get mad. I promise I will. I always do when you make me promise I won't. Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football. Homer! You promised you wouldn't get mad. I promised I would! She's eight years old! Marge, she's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids... whenever they show talent? Gambling is illegal. Only in 48 states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe... and it's brought Lisa and me together. I just don't know. What's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep... and I got that foot massager I've always wanted. Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this. You know, Dad... we've been watching a lot ofTV lately. Maybe the Sunday after the Super Bowl... we could climb Mt. Springfield. The fires in the tire yards make beautiful sunsets. Next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney. What about Daddy-Daughter Day?! The new football season is only seven months away. So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all. You're a very selfish man. Go to hell! Go to hell! Hey, once again, great present, Dad. Uh... uh... My third husband bought me this. Give me some chips for it. Are you sure? Don't tell me what to do. I've been gambling since I was eight... and hocking jewelry since I was I 2. Give me chips. Look around you, Malibu Stacy. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen-injection clinic. Back into the box. It may not be pretty... but damn it, it's honest. I, Lisa Simpson... am hereby giving away... all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacy accessories! Ahh! Look, I bought you... a Malibu Stacy chinchilla coat. Huh? You've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer. Lisa, honey, I'm sorry... but I really had a good time watching football with you... and I think you had a good time with me. Yeah, I did. We can still watch the Super Bowl together... can't we? Well, I would like to see what the fuss is about. It's a date. So... do you think the Redskins... will beat the spread? Put me down. I'll tell you who's going to win... but it will just validate my theory... that you cared more about winning money... than you did about me. Okay. I think Washington is a mortal lock. Washington! Whoo-hoo! However... What however? However what? However, I may also be so clouded with rage... that subconsciously... I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo. Do me a favor. Complete this sentence: Daddy should bet all his money on... I don't know. D'oh! If I still love you... Washington. If I don't, Buffalo. Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it. We're live from the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome... and Super Bowl 26. Today we're going to be seen... by people in I 50 countries all over the world... including our newest affiliate, W-Gimel-Aleph-Nun... in Tel Aviv. Stupid! Formidable. Every note is a dagger in my heart. I got to get out of here. Moe's Tavern... home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular. Ohh! Baloney. Bread! Got you down for 40 bucks. Good luck, Your Eminence. You can't take more of my money. I'm out of the bookie business. But Moe, you've been taking bets all... Barney, have a free beer. Wow! Don't worry, I'm not betting. What? Give me that. Aw. I had the greatest gift of all-- a little girl who could pick football... and I ruined it. We're two hours and 45 minutes through the pregame show. Our guest is Troy McClure... whose new sitcom premiers tonight... right after the game! Thanks, Bret. My new show's called Handle With Care. I playJack Handle, a retired cop... who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. The original odd couple. I fell in love with the script, Bret... and my recent trouble with the I RS sealed the deal. That's great, Troy. Ooh! Looks like... we're almost ready for the kickoff. Washington kicks. Oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo starts in excellent position. Buffalo's going to win. Lisa hates me. What did you bet? My daughter. What a gambler. And with the score at the half Buffalo I 4, Washington 7... it's time for the never-tedious Super Bowl halftime show. People of Earth, we've come ten billion light-years... to bring you this halftime message of peace. Oh, this sucks. Come on, snipers, where are you? Bart, who's winning? You-Hate-Dad by a touchdown. Go! Go! Go! Go! Yay!! Announcer: ...for halfback Dan Beerdorf. Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl. They wanted it more. Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins... your daughter loves you? Not Duff Dry, Washington. Okay, okay, they're both great teams. Yay! Yay! Huh? Touchdown, Redskins. All right, we're back in business. Well, I'm glad some people... could resist the lures of the big game. I forgot the game! It all comes down to this one play. If Washington scores, happy fans will be looting... and turning over cars in our nation's capital tonight. Please, please, please. Touchdown! It is done. The Washington Redskins win Super Bowl 26! You love Dad. I suspected as much. Yes! She loves me, she loves me. Why are you so happy? You didn't win money. Money comes and goes, but my daughter and I... can go on for eight more years! Come on, Dad! It's... beautiful. Isn't it, though? After I... catch my... breath... can we... go... home?
#03x15 - Homer Alone^I am not cleaning that. Mmm, who am I kidding? Now, Maggie... when you grow up... you can suck your pacifier all you want. Extra mustard for Bart's... sliced diagonally. Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust. Double bologna for Homer... Mom-- Mom-- Can you sign my-- Where's my lucky red cap? I hate those pimento things-- I split my pants again. Ooh! Can I have two sandwiches? I got a test today-- I can't eat those-- One at a time! One at a time! Double bologna! No pimentos! Don't forget to make it-- Mom, where's my-- That's enough! There you go, Lisa-- no pimentos. Bart, your hat's behind the toilet. Homer, I'll sew your pants, but I'm out of bologna. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Mom. D'oh! Videos to return... grocery list, flea dip for the cat... dry cleaning-- I think that's everything. Marge, can you take... my ball to Nick's? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole. I'm running late. Can't you use a ball at the alley? Ohh, alley balls? All right. Don't whine. Just put it in my left hand. Kids, hurry up or you're going to miss your bus. No way. Never happen. Well, I'll be damned. Bart's making faces at me. It's a nervous twitch, and I'm sensitive about it... if you don't mind. Get... out! Fruit leather... Tree Fresh imitation orange drink... Krusty brand duck sausage pizza-- You've got the wrong Nick's. You want Nick's... on the other side of town. I don't know what Nicky's telling you. I haven't flushed a ball in years. Oh, this miserable stress headache. Feels like there's a rat in my brain! It's time for another Bill and Marty... classic crank call. Hello, Mr.Justin Sherman? Yes. Your wife is dead. Oh, God, no! That's right. She just walked through a plate glass window. There's blood everywhere. I just talked to her. Bart's making faces. Where's my red cap? Alley balls? Your wife is dead. I haven't flushed a ball in years. Noooo!! Lady, this better be good. This is Arnie Pie with Arnie in the Sky. We've got big problems... on the Springfield Memorial Bridge. Traffic going waaay back in both directions. And look out at I 4th and Elm. I just dropped my bagel. She's locked in the car and refuses to move. Did you flash your lights? Yes. Well, I'm fresh out of ideas. All right! A chance to catch some rays. Come on! Come on! I got a body in the trunk. Mr. Genie, stop fiddling with the buttons. Oh! You've gotten chocolate all over everything. This is Kent Brockman... reporting from Arnie Pie's traffic 'copter... but this is no mere traffic report. Hey! Face the facts. An overworked and underappreciated housewife... has parked on the bridge, refusing to budge. This reporter will be lowered in the sky harness... for an exclusive interview. Huh? Ow! Hey! Ow! Sweetheart, what's the matter? Not getting enough of the good stuff? D'oh! Let me through. I'm her husband. That explains a lot. Try to talk her out of there... but don't put your lips on it. Hello. Hello! Is this thing on? Hello?! Homer, is that you? What should I say? How about, "Yes, it's me"? Yes, it's me. Tell her you love her. I love you very much. Awww. And, uh... later tonight, I think you and I should, uh... snuggle? Ha, ha! Uh, why don't you just wrap it up? I can tell something's bothering you... but if you come out of that car... I promise to do whatever it takes... to make it better. Please, honey? Okay. Cuff her, boys! Off the record, ma'am... all the gals on the force... knew just how you felt. That's nice. Could you loosen my cuffs? No. Don't worry. She'll be cracking rocks by the end of the week. You glorified night watchman... let her go! But she broke the law. Thanks for the civics lesson. If Marge Simpson goes to jail... I can kiss the chick vote good-bye... and if I go down, you're breaking my fall! Quimby, don't write checks your butt can't cash. Hear me, Wiggum, you bite me, I'll bite back. You talk the talk, Quimby, but do you walk the walk? I hereby declare today to be Marge Simpson day... in the city of Springfield. They're like seals-- toss 'em a fish... and watch 'em slap their fins together. Well, all's well that ends well. Good night, Marge. Many years ago... the Spanish explorers discovered their piece of heaven... nestled in the Springfield Mountains. They called it Rancho Relaxo... and so do we. Today, it's Springfield's only two-star health spa. Swim, play tennis... or just sit and stare at the walls. At Rancho Relaxo, you're the boss. Remember, you can't spell Relaxo without relax. Homer? Homer! What? I need a vacation. What?! But, Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns? I need to unwind. I know you do, Marge... but you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the backseat-- "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" And I'm no day at the beach either. "Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?" No, I mean... a vacation by myself. What?! You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change. No, Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations. Well, okay... but you have to swear you're coming back. I swear. All right, then. Thanks for taking the children while I'm away. Don't worry yourself. We've got six months of maternity leave... we'll never use anyway. Homer, bring Maggie out. Wish I'd thought of that. She's starting to give. Homer, if Maggie... doesn't want to leave the house... maybe she should just stay with you. Are you sure that's wise? He'll probably trade her... for a beer and a nudie magazine. For your information, I can take care of my-- See? Got her on the first bounce. All aboard for Shelbyville, Badwater... Cattle Skull Testing Grounds, and Rancho Relaxo. Good-bye, Homie. Good-bye? Where's my clean underwear? Check the dryer. How often should I change Maggie? Whenever she needs it. Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker? Don't! Restful, easy listening. Coming up next... a super-set of songs about clouds. Hmm? Hello, Maggie. Sorry, honey. Mommy went crazy... and went far, far away... so it's going to be just you and me for a while. Just you and me. You haven't touched your tongue sandwiches. Are you thirsty? We've got Clamato, Mr. Pibb, and soy milk. That's all right. I think I'll just hit the hay. It's I 2:30 in the afternoon. I'm aware of the time. Lisa, you'll sleep in my bed. Bart, you'll sleep with Aunt Patty. In your bed? Uh-huh. And I should warn you... I'm told I snore. Ooh, Divorce Court is on in I 5 minutes! I'm scared, Lisa. You think you know fear? Well, I've seen them naked. Oh, hello... and welcome to Rancho Relaxo. I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such films as... Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die, and Gladys, the Groovy Mule. But today you'll see me in my greatest role-- your video tour guide to Rancho Relaxo. Our tour starts in your own room... where Relaxo-vision offers you the latest Hollywood hits... and after midnight... the finest " R" rated movies Europe has to offer. Ooh-la-la!

This whole pot is only I 4 calories. Oh, Gregory... where have you been all my life? Feeling tense? Uh-huh. Then just push nine... on your phone... then the pound sign, then 4-8-3. We'll do the rest.

It's the worst thing I've ever done. Don't worry. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make you an omelet. Just help me look. Are you sure? I make them with two kinds of cheese. Homer, I think I've got her. Come on! Barney, you'll pull her arm off!. The sooner I get her out... the sooner we can have omelets. Hmm, so, what's the verdict? Oh, dear God. I can't even put a bag over my head. Yes, you can. I'd like the Department of Missing Babies. Please hold. Hmm, I guess I've done everything.

#03x17 - Homer at the Bat^Mmm, doughnuts. Hey, Homer, slow down. You're going to choke or something. Don't tell me how to eat doughnuts. Hey, Homer's choking again. Isn't there a first aid chart around here somewhere? Somebody scare him. That's for the hiccups. Hey, look at this. Softball starts this week. Softball? Who's next? Count me out. Not me. No way. What's the matter with you guys? Last year we were 2 and 28. It wasn't our best season. Actually, it was. This year it's gonna be different. What makes you so damn sure? I have a secret weapon. Hey, he's been holding out on us, huh? A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be. Hmm. Count me in. I'm there. Come here, boy. I want to show you something. What's that? A homemade bat? It's something very special-- a homemade bat. It all started last year... during a terrible thunderstorm... when I locked myself... out of the house. Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal... I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find. Something told me this was a very special... very magical piece of wood that I could make a bat out of. I put my homemade football on hold... and set to work making the world's greatest bat. Homie, come to bed. Homer, go back to the garage. And here it is. Wow! How many home runs... you going to hit with that? We play 30 games, I 0 at bats a game-- 3,000. Hit one here, Charlie! Let's go over the ground rules. You can't leave first until you chug a beer. Any man scoring has to chug a beer. Chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings. And the fourth inning is the beer inning. Hey, we know how to play softball. Play ball! Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at Fifth and Main. Turn off that damn radio! And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy. Mom, why don't you let me call the game? That's all right, dear. I can do it. Men, stop that! Okay, Homer, bases loaded, and you're up. Where's that secret weapon? Check it out, boys. My magic bat. That's it? Yeah, I got a magic bat too. And I got an enchanted jockstrap. Yeah.Just watch. Whoo-hoo! All right, Homeboy! Yeah! Ha-ha! Cops can't win! Get his license and registration. Right, Chief. Wow, Dad. Homer, can I get you a beer? No. I want to get him a beer. Kids, kids, you can each get me a beer. But first, let's see it again in super slow motion. Why, you-- Huh? Ooh! Such a mighty wallop. I got my magic bat off a piano. My sister let me use her wooden leg. Good news, sir. The softball team won again. If we beat Shelbyville, we capture the pennant. Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub, and the title is ours. Ha! The Gladiators from my power plant... will crush your team like nine flabby grapes. I disagree. Would you care to bet a million dollars? Why don't we make it interesting? What, a million dollars isn't interesting? Did you say a million? I'm sorry. My mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount... we would bait each other and-- You know how it goes. Certainly. A million will be fine. Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat to win a million dollar bet? Yes, sir. Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat to win a million dollar bet? No, sir. Who would you like killed? No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers-- professional baseballers. We'll give them token jobs at the plant... and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson... Mordecai Brown-- Uh, sir. What is it, Smithers? I'm afraid all those players have retired... and, uh, passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for I 30 years. Damnation! Find me some good players-- living players. Scour the professional ranks-- the American League, the National League... the Negro leagues. I'm on my way. Oh, and, Smithers... you have 2 4 hours. I get $50,000 to play one game? That's right, Mr. Canseco. It's a pay cut, but what the hey. It sounds like fun. Uh... oh-- Hey, sorry. I thought you were a deer. Oh, that's okay. Happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia? That's me. How do you like working for the Dodgers? It's okay... but sometimes I wish I had something more blue collar... with big machines and cool dials and stuff... like an oil refinery... or hydroelectric plant. We should talk. And this is Elvis'rec room. When the King wasn't rehearsing or exercising... he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once. Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle. Are you Ozzie Smith? Yes. I have a proposition for you. Hello. Are you Don Mattingly? Yes. Yes, I am. Come in. Come in. Can I get you something? What's your name? How would you like to be a ringer... on a small-town company softball team? Would I? Now I'd like to introduce... the new members of our happy power plant family. Our security guard, Roger Clemens. Hello. Ourjanitor, Wade Boggs. How you doing? Our lunchroom cashier, Ken GriffeyJr. Hey, what's up, guys? Our new, well, uh... we'll make up jobs for these fellas later. Say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry... Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia andJose Canseco. Ooh. Wow. Geez. By the way, you new fellas, there's a sign-up sheet... for the softball team on the board over there... just in case you wish to play. Wait a minute. What's going on? With them on the team, you won't need us. Well, duh. You, Scioscia, sign up. I'm here to run the solid contaminate encapsulator. One more outburst, and I'll send you back to the big leagues. You're Darryl Strawberry. Yes. You play right field. Yes. I play right field too. So? Are you better than me? Well, I've never met you, but... yes. It's not fair. We worked so hard to get to the championship game... and we'll be sitting on the bench. You hit so many home runs. What makes you think... this Darryl Strawberry is better than you? Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster, stronger... and he already has more friends around the plant than I do. You make me sick, Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I put my mind to it. Now that you're older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are... there's always a million people better. Gotcha-- Can't win, don't try. As your new manager, I want to say this up front-- No one is assured a spot in the starting lineup. I don't care if you're Steve Sax... or Darryl Strawberry or-- What's one of the bad players' names? Homer Simpson, sir. Or Homer Simpson. Secondly, instead of beer, you will all drink this. It's a brain and nerve tonic... rich in proteins and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. It has been known to cause gigantism... but only in rare cases. Try some. It's like there's a party in my mouth... and everyone's invited. Excellent. Let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers... the medicine balls. Ugh. Ugh. Here. What are you gonna do with your million dollars? Throw it in the pile, I suppose. You are all very good players. We are all very good players. You will beat Shelbyville. We will beat Shelbyville. You will give I 1 0%. That's impossible. No one can give more than I 00%. By definition, that is the most anyone can give. I got it! I got it! Yes. Hey! I called for that. Put a lid on it. There's no "I" in "team." Some of these guys have a bad attitude, Skip. They sure do, Strawberry. Scioscia, I don't get it. You're a ringer, but you're here every night... busting your butt hauling radioactive waste. It's a relief from the pressures... of playing big league ball. There, you make any mistake, and boom-- the press is all over you. Uh-oh. Don't worry about it. Oh, man, is this ever sweet. Me, me. Pick me. Pick me, pick me. I pick Ken GriffeyJr. Aw, geez. Okay, I'll take Millhouse. Mr. Boggs, will you be on my team? You got yourself a player. Damn! All right, I'll take Louis. I'll takeJose Canseco. D'oh! Mattingly, get rid of those sideburns. What sideburns? You heard me, hippie. These guys aren't so tough. I've got Wonderbat. Take a knee, boys. Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives-- The Shelbyville game. So lights out at 7::30... and abstain from coffee, tea and cola drinks. They pack a wallop. Sure do, Skip. Before I post the starting lineup... I want to assure those who are not on the list... that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking. Let's call it heart. No hustle either, Skip. That's right, Darryl. All right. Way to go. Aw, nuts. Please, please, please. Clemens, did I make the team? You sure did. I did? Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry. Are you Ken GriffeyJr.? No. Didn't mean to get your hopes up. Ohhh. Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet... unless, of course, my nine all-stars... fall victim to nine separate misfortunes... and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible... seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance... but nine misfortunes-- I'd like to see that. What a nice little town. Maybe I'll buy a home here when I retire. What seems to be the problem, officers? That's enough, smart guy. Reach for your license. Slowly. Well, well. Steve Sax from New York City. I heard some guy got killed in New York... and they never solved the case. But you wouldn't know anything about that... now, would you, Steve? But there's hundreds of unsolved murders... in New York City. You don't know when to keep your mouth shut... do you, Saxy boy? Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm. Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate. I'm afraid you have a case... of acute radiation poisoning, Mr. Scioscia. Will... I... be... able... to... play... softball... tomorrow? No. By tomorrow... you'll barely be able to breathe. Oh... man. Dr. Hibbert... Ken GriffeyJr. needs to see you immediately. We think it's an overdose of nerve tonic. Good Lord! Gigantism! My baby! My baby! Don't worry, ma'am. I'll save your baby. Oh, thank you, Mr. Canseco. My cat! Never fear, ma'am. I'll save your cat. My player piano! Oh, man. Ohh, one thing I'm good at, and I can't do it anymore. Homie, you're good at lots of things. Like what? Like snuggling. Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me. And I say... England's greatest prime minister... was Lord Palmerston! Pitt, the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Pitt, the Elder! Okay, you asked for it, Boggs. Uh! Yeah, that's showing him, Barney. Pitt, the Elder. Lord Palmerston! Nice work, boys. We can close the book... on every unsolved crime in our fair city. Don't I get to call my lawyer? You watch too many movies, Sax. How long does it take to see this thing? I'm in a hurry. It's hard to say. Once you go in, you may never come out. Wow! One, please. Where do you think you're going? To the game. No. I don't want you to see me... sitting on my worthless butt. We've seen it, Dad. For the last time, get rid of those sideburns. I don't know what you think sideburns are, but-- Don't argue with me! Just get rid of them! It's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers? Mike Scioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six life sentences. Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth. Cool! What about Canseco? The dryer goes on the right. Yes, ma'am. What about Clemens? Sir, he's in no condition to play. That damn hypnotist! You! Look what you've done. My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken. I'm going to report this... to the American Hypnotical Association. But I did a good job... a good job. I guess it's not your fault. You did a good job. Mattingly! I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good! Fine. I still like him better than Steinbrenner. All right, you ragtag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers... you're all I've got. So I want you to remember... some inspiring things... that someone else may have told you... in the course of your lives... and go out there and win. Not so fast, Simpson. The man who plays your position is here. Hit the pine. Ohhh! You stink, Strawberry! We want Home Run Homer! Darryl. Darryl. Darryl. Darryl. Darryl. Darryl. Children, that's not very nice. Mom, they're professional athletes. They're used to this. It rolls right off their backs. Who wants peanuts? Hey, whoa! Ho, peanuts! Hey, peanuts! We got peanuts! Need some peanuts? Heads up! All right, Monty... it's up to your managerial skills. What to do-- Smithers, massage my brain. Yes, sir. You, Strawberry-- Hit a home run! Okay, Skip. I told him to do that. Brilliant strategy, sir. Ohhh! Oh, dear! Hmm. Children, tell me... when your father stops scratching himself. Kids? We'll tell you, Mom. All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth. Two outs, bases loaded. Strawberry coming up. They're gonna win the city championship. No thanks to me. Wait. You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter. Pinch-hitting for me? Yes. You're a left-hander... and so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter... it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ball games. I've got nine home runs. You should be very proud. Sit down. Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry. I am? Whoo-hoo! That a boy, Homer. You can do it. All right, Simpson. Let's go over the signals. If I tug the bill of my cap like so... Yeah. it means the signal is a fake. Uh-huh. I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly. Got it. If I want you to bunt, I'll touch my belt buckle... not once, not twice, but thrice. I don't understand a word he's saying. Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips. Mmm... potato chips. Got that, Simpson? Yes, sir. Now batting for Darryl Strawberry-- Homer Simpson. All right! Yea! Boo! Boo! Huh? Ugh! Oh, dear! No, Mom. It counts as a hit. Dad just won the game. Well, I guess he'll be happy... when he comes to. We won! We won! All right! Homer! Homer!

#03x18 - Separate Vocations^Now, class... I promised you... a surprise today. Wow! I knew it. And here it is. We're going to take a test. Oh! We're going to take a test. All right! A test! It's called the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test-- Or "CAN'T." Some of you may discover... a wonderful vocation you never imagined. Others may find out life isn't fair. In spite of your masters from Bryn Mawr... you might end up a baby-sitter to dead-eyed fourth graders... while your husband runs naked on a beach... with your marriage counselor! First question-- "If I could be any animal, I would be: A) a carpenter ant... B) a nurse shark... or, C) a lawyer bird." Question 60-- "I prefer the smell of: A) gasoline... B) french fries... or, C) bank customers." Well, that was a waste of time. Janie, school is never a waste of time. Since we have I 5 minutes until recess... please put down your pencils... and stare at the front of the room. Here for the tests. Come on, Emma. Here's your scientifically selected career. Architect! Mm-hmm. Insurance salesman. Mm-hmm. Salmon gutter?! Military strongman! Systems analyst,systems analyst, systems analyst. Systems analyst. All right! Homemaker? Mm-hmm. It's like a mommy. Police officer?! Well, I'll be jiggered. If you'd like to learn more... I could arrange... a ride-along in a police car. I don't need you to get me in a police car. You should consider this. Before I saw these test results, I had you pegged a drifter. Wow. A drifter. Lousy sheriff. Run me out of town. He's lost my vote. Cool. A homemaker.! I might as well be dead. It's not that bad. What will you be, boy? Policeman. Oh, that's nice. Your father wanted to be a policeman... but they said he was too heavy. The army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb. I'm going to be a famous jazz musician. I'll be unappreciated in my own country... but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French. I'll avoid drug abuse... but have several torrid love affairs... and I may or may not die young. I haven't decided. Honey, if that's what you want, we'll help. Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps? Tell me if I have what it takes... to be a blues musician. Show me your chops. Uh-huh. Yeah. Cool. So, you think she has talent? Sure. Do you think she could be a professional? Oh, Lord, no. But I'll practice every day. I'll be frank with you. When I say frank, I mean devastating. You've inherited a finger condition... known as stubbiness. It usually comes... from the father's side. D'oh! Stupid fingers. You're wrong! You're wrong! You don't need long fingers to play the blues. The blues come from in here. My God, they are stubby. I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here. Take it. No. We're here for your son. He's coming on a ride-along. Maybe this will straighten the boy out. Wow! Can I see your club? It's called a baton, son. What's it for? We club people... with it. Well! It's about time. So you guys... like being cops? Oh, it's great. You run red lights, park wherever you please... hot-and-cold-running chicks. And when you go home at night... you know you've made a difference. See that Caddie? Uh-huh. That's Mayor Quimby's car. Tonight his honor is... polling the electorate. How would you like a street named after you? I tell you. They only come out at night. Dear log... this will be my last entry... for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams... and now, I have none. Do you need straight A's to be a cop? Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys. It doesn't quite work that way, son. People see movies like McBain, and they think it's all... bang-bang, shoot-'em-up cops and robbers. Let's roll. One-Ocean-Tango. We're in pursuit of a speeding individual... driving a red... car, license number... Eggplant-Xerxes- Crybaby-Overbite-Narwhal. Oh, no. Cops. Whoo. They used nylon rope this time. It feels so smooth my skin-- almost sensuous. Ooh, baby. Damn boxes. He's trapped. Where's our backup? I don't know. Son, this is against every regulation... but would you cover us? Wow! Huh? See you in hell, punk. See you in hell, punk! Man, that was close. Good thing this alley got so narrow in the middle. Well, that's nice work, boys. Looks like you just bought yourself... a lottery ticket-- to jail. He's unconscious, sir. Oh, they can still hear things. Sir, I know... what I want to be when I grow up-- a cop. Until then, son... I'm making you an honorary police officer. Eddie, give him... your badge. Hey! Morning, honey. What's so good... about being stuck in the house... behind a stove? Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking... but it can really let you be creative. See? This morning I turned bacon, eggs, and toast... into a smiley face for Bart and Homer. What's the point? They'll never notice. Oh, well, you'd surprised. Hmm, umm, hmm... Now just relax your hand. Thank you, ma'am. You've been most cooperative. Bad dog! Very bad dog! Mom, before you blame the dog... take a look at these surveillance photos. Oh. Oh! Oh, Bart! I don't know how that got in there. Lisa, why aren't you at band practice? I quit. Right now you're discouraged... but you know you love the saxophone. I think you should stay in the band. If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band? Lisa! People like to tell you... what you can't do... but they don't always know what they're talking about. You know what I want to be? The girl on the oatmeal box? No. I'm going to be an astronaut. Women can't be astronauts. Why not? They distract the men... so they wouldn't keep their minds on the road. There will be women astronauts. It's true... and we'll all live... in cities on the moon. So, you see, my sisters were wrong-- except about the cities on the moon. I was wrong about that, so-- Well, you can see how anyone can be wrong. Sleek, vigilant puma-- principal of the mountains. Hi, Lis. Want to quiz me on the vowels? I'm ready to chuck the whole alphabet. Huh? Lisa, what are you doing? That's a bad-girl bathroom! Duh! You want to egg... Skinner's car? Okay. What are you looking at? Nothing. Then get out. We're figuring out stuff to egg. Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off... I suggest you attack the one thing... he truly believes in. I saw some awful things in 'Nam... but you really have to wonder at the mentality... that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this... but the no-goodniks rule this school. Get your hands off me.! God, I could really use a half day. Think you're big men with your handcuffs... and blasted Tasers! Get him out of here. I'll get you, Bart Simpson, if it's the last thing I do! What is this all about? It's quite simple, really. I observed our friend, Groundskeeper Willie, burning leaves-- a blatant disregard for our clean air laws. Bart Simpson on the side of law and order?! Has the world gone topsy-turvy? That's right, man. I got my first taste of authority... and I liked it. Hmm. There are a lot of troublemakers... in this school... and I can't be everywhere at once. Go on. Look, let's can the euphemisms. How would you like to be a hall monitor? Wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids? That's the meat of it. Hmm. Now, Witness X... would you please tell the court what you saw? I'd be more than happy to. I saw Mr. Montone there... seal Mr. Palaccio in an oil drum... and roll him off the pier. I kill you! Ay, caramba.! I don't know. Oh, now, you get to wear a sash. You got yourself a narc. Hey,Jimbo, keeping your nose clean, dude? Hey, Donna, who loves you, baby? Not in my hall, bub. I think you've had enough, sister. Come on, let's keep it moving. Pink belly! Pink belly! Pink belly! Break it up, boys. That belly ain't going to get any pinker. Wedgie! Thanks, Bart. Bart's grades are up a little this term... but Lisa's are way down. Oh, we always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good? We have three kids, Homer. Marge, the dog doesn't count as a kid. No. Maggie. Oh, yeah. Now take some paste and spread it... on the construction paper. Ralph, are you eating your paste? No, Miss Hoover. Good. Now sprinkle your sparkles on your paste. Lisa, you're not sprinkling your sparkles. Shove it. I have never seen... a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you... rebelling against? What do you got? ...and she goes... "Lisa told Hoover to shove it." And I'm, like, "No way--" Hey, Lisa, man. I'm, like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all "I'm so good." Want a smoke? Uh... I'll smoke it in class. Whoa! Whoa! Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. There were some corridors in this school... you'd never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere. Every day is a new fight, sir. Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. I have you to thank. Come with me. Madre de Dios.! The legends were true! Whenever a teacher confiscates something... it ends up here. Salacious halter tops... complete collections of Mad, Cracked... and the occasional issue of Crazy... and this plastic derriere. Now, to show my gratitude, I want you... to help yourself to an item of your choice. All right! You be careful with that crossbow. I will. This is an absence slip... signed by Nelson's mother... and this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the D's. Forgery! So he didn't have leprosy. I thought I could never teach again. Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock. Hey, Louis, watch this. Ow! Bart, do something! Let's go, Milhouse. Sure, we have order. But at what price? Now let's correct our homework exercises. Lisa, what I 9th-century figure was nicknamed "Old Hickory"? I don't know. You? Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment... you'd know the answer is... the Battle of New Orleans. I mean... Andrew Jackson. Well, you're earning your I 8 grand a year. Stupid Hoover. Thinks she's so smart. She wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition. Uh, ladies and gentlemen... the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen... every teacher's edition in this school. What do we do? Does anyone know... the multiplication table? Please, don't panic. They can smell fear. Children, for rest of day... Martin will be teaching... this class. But I wouldn't know where to begin. Do it, brainiac. Have I ever told you kids about the '60s? I've got to get out of here. Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean. I'm leaving again. Mr. Glasscock, please reconsider. Uh-uh. Bart, the police haven't had any luck... finding the teacher's editions. The dogs... have picked up the scent of books. Send in the battering ram. Here we go. We'll have to reorder every book. Seymour, I'll bet you... those books are still here. We have to search every locker. Locker searches... aren't permitted by the Supreme Court. Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately? Let's move. Hmm. Baa! Lisa! That's right. It was I. Lis, why did you do it? Come on, Bart! In your pre-fascist days... you knew the thrill of futile rebellion. Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this. I know! I know! The books! Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved this school $1 20. Who's behind this monstrous crime? I am. I've been blind. The signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor. Sorry I betrayed your trust, Principal "Sucker." In light of your recent service to the school... I've decided to be lenient. 400 days detention. 400 days. I can do that standing on my head. All right, 500 days. Ooh! Big man! 600 days. Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth. Let's go, Simpson. Bart, why did you take the blame? 'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and talent to go as far as you want... and when you do... I'll be right there to borrow money. Oh, Bart. Sounding good, Lis. 
#03x19 - Dog of Death^I don't need your crummy job. I won the lottery! Well, I won the lottery too! We both won the lottery! Why don't you win the lottery too? Where everybody wins! Actual odds of winning: one in 380 million. The lottery-- exploiter of the poor and ignorant. You know, I heard the jackpot's up to $1 30 million. $1 30 million? Did you say $1 30 million? Yeah. Wow! Here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Come again. Bart, I need some lucky numbers fast. How old are you? What's your birthday? No kidding. What's Lisa's birthday? What? You don't know your sister's birthday? Strap on your bulletproof vest. It's time for another bank run. If I don't make it... promise you won't sleep with my wife. I promise nothing. You'll never guess what happened, Marge. Are you ready? I have a feeling that we may win... the lottery! But we never, ever-- Calm down and listen to me carefully. Go get all your money-- I buy one lottery ticket a week... with the girls at the hair salon. That's enough excitement for me. The lottery is the one ray of hope... in my otherwise unbearable life! Uh, the lottery and you. We're on a tight budget. Promise you won't get carried away. Yes, money-- I mean honey. Ooh! Here comes the news about the lottery. Hey, down in front. The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever... and Springfield is no exception. In fact, every copy of ShirleyJackson's The Lottery... has been checked out from the library. The book does not contain hints on winning the lottery. It is a chilling tale of conformity gone mad. There's one big winner-- our state school system... which gets half the profits. Just think what we can buy with that money-- history books that know how the Korean War came out... and a state-of-the-art detention hall... where children are held in place with magnets. Magnets-- always with the magnets. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery. Homer, the odds are 380 million to one. Correction: 380 million to 50! What will you do with your share, kids? Bank it. Give it to the poor. What do kids know about spending money? What about you? Hmm. Homer, what did you do, get a haircut or something? Look closer, Lenny. Oh, you're the biggest man in the world now... and you're covered in gold. 1 4-karat gold. Take a hike, boss. I'm running things now. All hail King Homer. We now take you to the drawing live. I've got my tickets. They're about to start, Chief. No, you got the wrong number. This is 91 -- 2. We'll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket out of here, Mel. I will now draw the first winning number. I've got so many tickets I can't lose. The first number is I 7. D'oh! You can still win money... if you have five out of six. Woo-hoo! And the second number is three. D'oh! Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win. Well, why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret!? If you were I 7, we'd be rich. But no, you had to be ten. And the final number is... 49. 38... 49! Oh, my God. I won. I won! Recapping our day's top story: The winner of today's state lottery is... me, Kent Brockman. Can we get a shot of me? There you go. In other news, uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland. Many people killed. Uh... good-bye! Oh, well, we lost the money... but we've still got each other. Hey, the dog's dead. He's not dead. Don't say the dog's dead when he's not. It's not fair to toy with people's emotions. He is dead. I'll get a shovel. Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick. Oh, sure, the old man's off his rocker. If Grandpa says he's dead, he must be alive. He is alive. He's wagging his tail. Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home. Clear. Clear. Doctor, he's gone. This is the part of the job I hate. You did the best you could. I love animals. I spend my life saving them, and they can't thank me. The parrots can, but-- Let's see what's wrong with this little fellow. Hmm. I'm afraid your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it... or he'll die. How much will it cost? Seven hundred and fifty dollars. Oh, dear. This is never an easy decision. Well, I guess we'll have to talk it over. What's there to talk about? What are we going to talk over? Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum. We're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation? Uh... later. First I want to tell you... about the most wonderful place in the world-- doggie heaven. In doggie heaven, there's mountains of bones... and you can't turn around... without sniffing another dog's butt. All the best dogs are there-- Old Yeller and about eight Lassies-- Is there a doggie hell? There couldn't be a heaven without a hell. Who's in there? Oh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had, what's his name? Chester? Checkers. One of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one-- the one that mauled Timmy. Does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper? Oh, honey, $7 50 is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation. You'll let him die? I know you're upset. Darn right I'm upset! Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry. You're not going to let our dog die, and that's it! Lousy, dog-killing son-of-a-- Well, it will be okay. We'll get him a new dog-- one with an untwistable stomach. Oh, come on. I'm sorry but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop. Oh! All right, all right, we'll find a way. Lousy, manipulative dog. Uh, Mr. Burns... I need to borrow money. Please, do go on. [ Homer] I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick. Oh, please, continue. I thought maybe you-- Oh. Well, thanks for your time. What makes a man endanger his job... and even his life by asking me for money? People like dogs, Mr. Burns. Dogs are idiots. If I came into your house... and started sniffing at your crotch... and slobbering all over your face... what would you say? If you did it, sir? Exactly. You'd be fit to be tied. Dogs! Hmm. No! You are not performing that operation yourself. But, Marge, it looks so easy. Just like carving a turkey. Oh! Oh! Eww! Maybe you're right, Marge. I found a way we can pay for the operation. All right! Hear that, boy? What do you got, Marge, insurance scam? We're just going... to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while. Bart, you'll have to get your hair cut for free... at Springfield Barber College. No problemo. I'll give up my weekly lottery ticket... and I can stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will be organ meat night. Ham night will be spam night, and pork chop night... will be chub night. I don't even know what that is. Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting... Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store. But next week is volume four-- Copernicus through elephantiasis. We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer. Marge, I've figured out... an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats. I don't think you've thought this through. Good news, Mr. Danielson. We saved your gamecock... but he'll never fight again. That's what you think. He'll fight and he'll win. Clamp. Wipe. No! No! Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on. Um, Simpson? Oh, Santa's Little Helper, you're alive! We were so worried about you. It's times like this... I'm glad I flunked out of dental school. Lousy chub night. Hey, how come... he gets meat and we don't? You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly snouts and entrails. Mmm... snouts. Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of man... who would leave a $500,000-a-year job... because he won a lottery. I'm a journalist. He's got all the money in the world... but there's one thing he can't buy. What's that? A dinosaur. I'm not the only one benefiting from last week's big payoff. State schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary... with a brand-new eraser. One eraser? I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in 'Nam. I served for-- And speaking of lotteries... here are the winning numbers for this week's $40,000 jackpot. 3-6-1 7-1 8-22 and 29. Oh, no! Those are my numbers. If it wasn't for that dog, I would have won. For tomorrow, I want you to write a report... on Copernicus. D'oh! Come on, booze hound. You want the 25 cents? Keep singing! Who's that old rummy? Before his dog got sick... that old rummy used to be my best customer. Sing it, baby! My quarter! Okay, I'll just even this out and-- Mr. Laswell... I've done it again. I know you can't understand me... but you're a lousy dog and I hate you. Not now. Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography... of Copernicus I found at the bus station? Dumb dog. Homie, did you close the gate? Yes. Oh, you mean tonight. The dog will get out. Bart, close the gate! Oh, Lisa, close the gate! Close the gate, Maggie! Here, boy! Here, Santa's Little Helper! Oh... it's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog. Oh, he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is! No, that's a horse. Have you found a picture yet? Not one that I want the public to see. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. Oh, dear. So, recycling... is our way of giving Mother Earth a big hug. Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage... like some starving raccoon. Release the hounds. Well, neighbor... I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing. What's wrong with Crippler? He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late '60s. I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too groovy. I'm looking for something... in an attack dog-- one who likes... the sweet, gamey tang of human flesh. Why, here's the fellow. Wiry, fast, firm, proud buttocks. Reminds me of me. Ah, the last one. D'oh! As an attack dog... you'll be expected to neutralize intruders. Want to buy some cookies? If that was a Girl Scout... I'd have been bothered by now. I know how you feel. I lost my dog too. He's in here somewhere. [ "Ode toJoy"from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 playing ] Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again. That was his dish... and that was his leash... and that's where he took a whiz on the rug. Homer, get a hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember? Doggie heaven? Oh, Marge! There is no such place. Or... to put it another way... there is. I'm not giving up. If I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town... I'm going to find my dog. And I'll be right here watching TV. Poka, poka, poka. Poka, poka, poka. Excellent. Hello. I'm Kent Brockman. Excuse me, sir. I lost my dog. And you want me to buy you a new one. Since I won the lottery... everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman-- homeless this and hungry that. Gee, I'm sorry, mister. Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy. Good! I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir... but there's a sweet little boy at the door. Release the hounds. Santa's Little Helper! It's you! What's the matter, boy? I'm your buddy. I love you, boy. Let me pet him again. You already petted him for ten minutes. I want to pet him again. You can pet the cat. The cat? What's the point? Good boy, Santa's Little Helper. Oh, good boy. This will never happen again. You can have anything you want. You can sleep on my bed, you can chew on slippers. Yeah, he's a good doggie. 
#03x20 - Colonel Homer^Look, Dad, there's a spot. D'oh! There's a spot, dear. D'oh! Oh, there's a good one. That spot says "compact only." Marge, that's just a suggested car size. Easy. Easy. How am I doin' on the right? We're getting a lot of sparks here, Dad. Uh-huh. Easy. Easy. Perfect. All right, everybody, out the window. They all look great. What are we going to see? Ernest Cuts the Cheese.! Honey, I Hit a School Bus.! Look Who's Oinking.! Since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie... your dad and I will pick one, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Thanks, Mom. Two tickets for-- Let me guess. Look Who's Oinking. That's right. Sold out. Maybe we could see something a little more adult. Why, Marge, you frisky little devil. [ Sexy Growl ] We'll take two tickets to The Stockholm Affair. Ooh. The paper called it a taut political thriller. Political? Mr. President, disturbing news. Serious cracks are developing in the Greco-Bolivian alliance. Get meJed Colic! Oh, this movie's too complicated. Hey, the floor's sticky. Who's that guy? What did that guy say when I said, "Who's that guy?" Oh, that submarine is so fake. Look, you can see the strings. Ooh! An octopus! Shh! What? If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it. Just tell me when the scary part's over. It's over. I think that guy's a spy. Of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school. Oh, wait. I heard how this ends. Turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter. It's pretty obvious if you think about it. Shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think! Yeah! Homer, if it makes you feel any better... most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer? Forget it, Mom. Dad's really mad. His tendons are throbbing. Stress is collecting in the trouble spots-- here, here, and here-- making for one unhappy pappy. Homie, aren't you coming inside? Marge, I have always carried myself... with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight, you robbed me of it. I'm going now, and I don't know when you'll see me again. I guess that executive stress ball we got him isn't working. Mmm. Eww, a skunk. Oh, no! Ooh, a redneck bar. Hey, you, let's fight. Them's fightin' words. Duff, please. We don't sell Duff. We sell Fudd. Okay, Fudd me. All right. Ladies and gentlemen... he's all healed up and back for more.

That's a pretty name. You think so? Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it. Bye, Lurleen. So long, HomerJ. Simpson. Hello. Where were you all night? I was at this bar in Spittle County.

Right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress... but she's going to be a country music superstar... like that jerk in the cowboy hat and that dead lady. I don't like you hanging around some waitress. You make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer... watching her try on some outfits. Hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife. It's a date. Oh, Homer. Everybody's been calling-- Mama, Daddy, the triplets... Vonda Mae, PineyJoe-- and I owe it all to you. Don't thank me. You should be thanking your brain. Oh, Homer. No man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wanting something in return. I was gonna ask for some water, but now I feel guilty about it. Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar. Thanks. You did say "sugar," right? Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager. Really? I should warn you, I'm not great with figures. That's okay. I make stupid decisions. Nobody's perfect. I did bad in school. I didn't even go. My personal hygiene has been described as-- Homer, Homer, you'll be a great manager. There's only one thing you need. This is made from a space-age fabric... developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit. Hmm. Marge, look at me. I don't want to. I'm mad at you. I'm sick of that waitress... and this whole country music thing. Then you'd better not look at me. Homer, where did you get that suit? A friend bought it for me. Was it Lurleen? No. I think it was Lenny. Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair? No! Have you kissed her? No! Has she kissed you? Couple of times. I want you to stop seeing her. I can't. I'm her manager. Her manager! That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family. You're standing in the way of my boyhood dream... of managing a beautiful country singer! Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. You did it at the county fair last year, remember?

I'm sure Lurleen will love it. How much did you just give that man? Calm down, Marge. Just our life savings. I'm not going into hock for this. Hey, Colonel Homer. And you must be-- Mrs. Homer Simpson. Charmed. I thought you said she was overweight. It takes two to lie-- one to lie and one to listen. What does that mean? I don't have time to answer that.

#03x21 - Black Widower^Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music? Don't have a stegosaurus, man. These talking dinosaurs are more real... than most real families on TV. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Look, Maggie, they have a baby too. It's like they saw our lives and put it up on screen. Kids, I know you're excited... about meeting Aunt Selma's boyfriend. Before he gets here... I should tell you something about him-- something disturbing. Ooh! Ooh! Ee-ugh! Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession... about not dying alone... so in desperation... she joined this prison pen pal program. Her new sweetie is a jailbird. Cool, he can teach us... how to kill a man with a lunch tray. Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society. Then why aren't you using... the good silverware? I'm just not. That's them. Remember, everyone... be understanding and forgiving... for the sake of family unity. Everyone... I'd like you to meet-- Aah! It's Sideshow Bob! What the..? I'm afraid their reaction is understandable. Bart is the shamus in short pants who sent me to prison. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown... for armed robbery. If some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison... the first thing out I'd find out where he lives... and tear him a new belly-button. Lousy snitch. Yaah! You're forgetting the first two noble truths... of the Buddha. I am not. Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire-- in this case, my desire to do high-quality... children's programming. When prison ended that dream, I became a seething cauldron... of rage and recrimination. When I was nominated for best supporting performer... in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards... my bitterness ruined the greatest night of my life. And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers... Colonel Coward... Pepito, the biggest cat in the whole wide world... Sideshow Bob... and Suckup the Vacuum. And the Emmy goes to... I don't believe this... Sideshow Bob. This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win... you bantering jack-in-the-box! Just don't drop it in the shower. No-talent, shill! Second banana! Panderer! Bore! Uh, now for the highlight of the evening-- Best film-to-video transfer. Do you know what prison is like... for a life-long Republican? In our overcrowded cell we became little more than beasts. Who used my chap stick? Oh, I did. Here you go. I don't want it. My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge... against the boy who put me there. Ay, caramba! Bart, if I wanted to kill you... I'd have choked you as soon as I walked in. But what kind of guest would I have been? Now, where was I? Ah, yes-- my lowest ebb. You can't take my Emmy. You know the rules: awards for entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe. But kismet be kind, well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter... from the prison pen pal program. "Dear no. 2 460 1... I need a man and cannot find one... among the law abiding. I have a steady job and a lucrative hobby: filing nuisance lawsuits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am." "Dear Selma... your latest letter set off a riot... in the maximum-security wing of my heart." Ohhh... [ Pffft ] Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard... our love bloomed despite all obstacles. Selma, may I? Uh, uh, uh... on the cheek. Inspired by the love of a good woman... I resolved to be the best darned inmate No. 2 460 I I could be. I bade farewell to my cellmates... and left with the woman I loved. Cutter. Icepick. Snake. I'm going to miss you most of all. Aww! What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving-door prison system works. I've never seen you so happy-- giggling like a schoolgirl. I've got to admit it, Selma... he's a once-in-a-lifetime catch. I hope the police are saying that as well. I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown. Bart! Indeed, I did... and I thank you for catching me. You seized the wheel... of my slow boat to hell, and pointed it... towards the sunny shores of Selma. Here, here. Would you mind... if I did something bold and shocking... in front of your family? All right, but no tongues. Though kissing you is like kissing some divine ashtray... that's not what I had in mind. Selma, will you marry me? [ Gasps ] Don't be a fool. That man is scum. Then call me "Mrs. Scum." Could you... pumice my corns for me? Avec plaisir. "A"... "G"... "Q"... Seven... Close enough. May you drive safely... and find true love. We now return to... Whoo-hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys. So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in. What's next? Oh, yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction... "The Chairman of the Company"-- you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you gumba! who wants to say hello. Huh? What? I can't believe it! They've been feuding for years. Come here, you. Oh, you old clown, you. I missed you. This guy is a national treasure. That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle. All I can be is myself. Krusty, can you ever forgive me for putting you in jail? If they open the books on this telethon I'm right back in there. That Sideshow Bob is a no-good show biz phony. Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him surely you can too. Now, about your wedding dress... how should I put this? White! White. What would you like for appetizers? Ooh, appetizers. Homer, you're a trencherman. What should we serve? Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look... and they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like ketchup, it tastes like ketchup... but, brother, it ain't ketchup! Selma, he makes a good case. Whatever you want. It all tastes like Styrofoam to me. Selma, dear, I'm confused. When I was a kid... we were playing with bottle rockets... and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell. Okay, we've got cocktail weenies and Swedish meatballs. Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. I've run through eight of the ten dollars... they gave me when I left prison. I told you I got money. I bought stock in a Mace company... just before society crumbled. Selma, that's wonderful! I hope people don't think... I'm marrying you for your money... instead of your... less tangible qualities. Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand? Hey, Bob, give some of that honey this way. Mmm... mmm! Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver. Driver, here's a fin. Get me home, and don't spare the whip. Whatever you say, mum. What did I miss? MacGyver was wearing a tank top. Dang. But I'm the only man in your life. Sit down and shut up! Señor MacGyver, you saved our village. Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull. That MacGyver's a genius. First of all, he's not a genius. He's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor. You're lying. You're lying! No, this is lying-- that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap... that never made me retch. No! He was so cruel. The things he said... they're just not true. There. There. The wedding's off. Fiddle-dee-dee. Tomorrow's another day. Bart, stop that! No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding's off. Selma, I don't know what to say. Just tell me you like MacGyver. Very well. I-- I-- I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on. Would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes... but it's no big deal. You know why? No. Go on. Whenever Marge puts on... one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I pound a few... then I stumble home in the mood for love. Very well, Selma. Whenever you watch MacGyver... I'll take a vigorous constitutional... and return more in love than ever. Oh, Bob. Bart no like. Bad medicine. I could have been the flower girl... and I wouldn't keep falling down either. Hey, they chose Maggie, okay? If you want to go for cutesyness... instead of competence, fine. Do you, Bob, take Selma... to have and to hold, in sickness and in health... till death do you part? Mmm. Oh. Hey, wiener boy... where do you think you're going? I'm the only single girl left in the family. Well, I guess it could be worse. Oh, there's Krusty the Clown. Krusty! Krusty, say something funny. Oh, gee, a joke, huh? Um... uh... funny. Okay, this guy walks into a bar... and takes out a tiny piano and a I 2-inch pianist-- Oh, no, wait. I can't tell that one. Dear friends, 41 years ago... God took I 68 pounds of clay, and he made me a woman... and for this, I thank him. I just wanted to say... on the advice of my new husband... I've decided to give up smoking... except for after meals and after MacGyver. Selma, dear, you'll bury us all. Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you? Lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime... would he have invited the number-one cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got some cake. I don't know what to say. Just tell me what you know I want to hear. I'm dying of jealousy. Thank you. That's right, dear. Enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you... and the honeymoon is going to be... murder. Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera cousin Doug gave us... and the videocassette Homer gave us. Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it. There's Shelbyville Falls, Rolling Rock... and here's another breathtaking sight... my brand-new hubby. I wanted a room with a fireplace... you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure! Oh, Selma, dear. I was just chatting with my good friend... Dennis. Now, smile for the camera, that's a good lad. Ah, fire-- Scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows... eradicator of deadwood. Oh, Selma, dear-- you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while? And make love? I suppose so. Oh, that's sweet. Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace? Because he wants his honeymoon... to be romantic. Romantic? With Aunt Selma? I guess you're too young to understand. Hmm... Bob, one of my fillings fell out. Even murder has its ugly side. Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet? Darling, you make it sound like a chore. Ooh. Oh. Good. Mmm. Soon I will kill you. Huh? Son pieds sentit beau-- French for "her foot smells lovely." Oh. Prepare to be murdered. Huh? That's... Sanskrit for "your toes are like perfume." Voy a matar a usted. Wha? That's Spanish for "I am going to kill you." Say what? I do believe it's time... for your beloved MacGyver. Oh, hey, you're right. Well, time for my walk. Mm. Don't forget to die. Ding-dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TVwith you? Oh, go ahead, Patty. Tonight, on MacGyver... MacGyver... MacGyver... MacGyver... Aunt Selma has one hour to live. Hey, down in front. Good-bye. Front desk, there's been a terrible accident in my room! Poor Selma. You were having... such a lovely evening... Selma! Oh! You tried to kill me. I want a separation. My best-laid plans have gang agley. Do you have room in your jail... for a two-time loser? No, but that never stopped us before. Bart, I must know... how did you untangle my web? Yeah, Bart, clue us in. I'd hate to tell the number-one cop in town... how to do his job. No, please, it's the only way I'll learn. All right. Sideshow Bob seemed desperate... to get that fireplace, but why? Then it hit me-- The gas! Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak... except Aunt Selma. I permanently lost my sense of smell. She happily watched MacGyver... unaware that her room... was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode... was a single spark, say, from a cigarette. I've decided... to give up smoking... except after meals and MacGyver. Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father. When Aunt Selma lights up after MacGyver... she'll be blown to kingdom come. Come again? After trying four times to explain it to Homer... I explained it to Mom and we were on our way! To the Simpson Mobile! But wait. If you saved Selma, why did the room explode? Oh, I'll field that one. Oh, right, the gas. with all my criminal buddies! I feel like such a fool. Well, he fooled almost everyone... but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust. Thanks, Mom. Now, let's get out of this gas-filled hallway... before we all suffocate. 
#03x22 - The Otto Show^Hey, Homer, let's book! I want to whip eggs at the warm-up act. Wow, my concert-going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer. Billy Beer! My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud. Oh, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts... and it never hurt me. I hear you. Come on, boy. There goes Davy Crockett... in his bald-skin cap. In other Spinal Tap news... Mayor Quimby honored the aging super group... in a ceremony at city hall. "Tapping" into the "spines" of young voters, huh? Let's play the tape. Hey, Milhouse, cool jacket. It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe comics. Meet me here after the show. Thanks, Dad. You won't be bored? Boy, some of the best times I've ever had... were in the back seat of a car. Ohhh... Oh, baby. Ahh. Official tour '92 T-shirts, $31 . Check it out-- Spinal Tap kicking Moammar Khadafy... in the butt. A timeless classic. Hey, Bill and Marty here. And we're rapping with the Tap. Fellas, this phrase has dogged you... throughout your career-- "Washed up." Yet you're among the top I 05 concert acts today. What's your secret, guys? After the Berlin Wall fell our records started selling... on the dismal side of the lron Curtain. That gave us a boost. We're big in Bulgaria, and the other Garia. Hungaria? Who's benefited... more from the death of communism than us? Maybe the people who live in communist countries. I bet you're right. But we each just bought our own soccer team. How many Hungarios can say that? Test... test... Gee, I'm sorry, man. Huh? About the frisbee. Frisbee? Would you mind... recording some promos? Like what? Maybe you could say... "Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL." We don't know that. What if somebody rocks as good as you? Or better. We don't want to look stupid. We respect that. How about, "Rock-a-doodle-doo! You're listening to Bill and Marty"? Yeah, sure. That's good. Tap! Tap! Tap! There's puddles of water... all over the freakin' stage. Well, I don't want to lie. Six days a week the place is a hockey rink. Well, this is a rock concert... not the bleedin'... splish-splash show. Ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls... Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes... is proud to welcome Spinal Tap! Medium setting. Thank you! All right! This morning we were driving down... route 401 . That's only four miles from my house! And we thought they could rock in Shelbyville. But nobody rocks like... Springfield! Well, it seems some silly twit... did not get a big enough oxygen pump... but that's supposed to be a devil. Filled with air, it's very evil and impressive. We salute you, our half-inflated dark lord! Oy! Oy! Oy! People think there are only five members of Spinal Tap... but they're wrong. Could we turn up the house lights? That was the cue to turn up the lights... so we can tell the audience... they're the sixth member of the freakin' group! We are trying to put a tiny thrill... into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it. Turn on the lasers. Aah! My vision. That's it. Show's over. Good night, Springden. There will be no encores. They were only on for 20 minutes. What a gyp. Gnarly show, man. Want to trash the stage? Okay. Aah! Tonight the city weeps... as for the first time ever... a hockey arena becomes the scene of violence... following a concert by Spinal Tap. I hope my poor little baby's okay. See for yourself. Unh! It would be wrong to suggest... this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots... at the premiere of Mozart's The Magic Flute. So, what's the answer-- ban all music? In this reporter's opinion, the answer is yes. Hi, Mom. Oh... Oh, thank God. Mom, I want to be a rock star. Mm... We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay? Uh... I'll be right back. Help! Help! I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician... let's buy him a guitar. We already have a guitar. I meant a real guitar. This is real. Wow! And it came with a free instruction book. We spent a lot of money... so you get real good, real fast, or pow.! Homer! I thought I was supposed to encourage him. I'd like to play me latest chart topper. It's called... "Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs." Bart, you've got to go on. Slag off. You've changed, man. It used to be about the music. I said slag off!. Cool! Knock it off. I'm sorry. Knock it off!. I's just jammin' with ya. Hey, Simpson... what are you trying to play? "Polly-wolly Doodle." Oh, yeah? Well, it sounds Polly-wolly crappy. Burn. Hey, cherry ax, Bart dude. I think it's broken. Oh, really? Give it here. I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto man. That's all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time... and I'd never amount to anything. I, uh... Hmm. Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit. Although I'm sure... I will receive a wedgie from my bus mates... I must remind you... we should have been at school ten minutes ago. Uh-oh. Better fasten your seat belts, little dudes. We don't have seat belts. Uh... Well, then just try to go limp. Better take a shortcut. Good show last night. Yeah, quite good. Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number? Gee, I forgot. Uh, no. Yay! Whee! It's a miracle... no one was hurt. I stand on my record-- 1 5 crashes and not a single fatality. Let's see your license, pal. No can do. Never got one. If you need proof of my identity... I wrote my name on my underwear. Oh, wait-- these aren't mine. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear... you are suspended without pay. Who will drive the bus? I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it. Where's Otto? That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for a while. Off we go. Oh, there's an opening. Oh, too late. Nope, nope... Uh... That would cut it a little close. You have to be more aggressive, sir. Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in. Nope. What's so funny? I was thinking about the time... Homer caught his nose in the toaster. We'll watch the tape tonight. You got someone at your window. My name's Patty. I'll be testing you. When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions? Yeah, one: Have you always been a chick? No offense, but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me. I'm open-minded. I won't be needing this. All right! Yeah! How did I do? Well, you failed every segment... and misspelled "bus" on your application. Drag. Let me in. Let me in! Shut up! Hey, Landlord, some clown changed my locks... padlocked the door, and put up an eviction notice. Yeah. That was me. You? Well, uh... Why? You haven't paid your rent. Can I at least get my stuff? All I found in there was a jar of mustard... and a couple of old Cycle magazines. Wow! I had mustard? Rough day, Apu. Pump me a squishee and don't spare the syrup. Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of mine-- a delicious chutney squishee. Uh... Okay. You can really taste the chutney. Ow! Otto man? You're living in a Dumpster? Oh, man, I wish. Dumpster brand trash bins are top-of-the-line. This is just a Trash-co waste disposal unit. Come home with me. You can stay in our garage. A garage! Somebody up there likes me. Whoo! Hey. Bart, what's going on? Mom, I thought... you might forget... our conversation this afternoon... so I took the precaution of recording it. What conversation? Mom, can Otto live in our garage? He sure can. Marge, what were you thinking? That's not my voice. Oh, everybody says that... when they hear themselves on tape. I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents? The admiral and I don't get along. Please, I've got nowhere else to go. Forget it-- That line didn't work for my dad... and it won't work for you. Otto's going through a tough time. Can't he stay for a while? I know we didn't ask for this, Homer... but doesn't the Bible say... "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers... that you do unto me"? But doesn't the Bible also say... "Thou shalt not take... moochers into thy... hut"? Please, Dad? If you let Otto stay... he'll help around the house... and chip in a few bucks. All right, he can stay... but I get to treat him like garbage. Wow, what's the catch? The can of corn costs... 57 ¢! I could sure go for a can of corn. Otto... you can't just sit there watching TV all day. You're right. I should do a little reading. Uh, you got any of those Where's Waldo? books? No. Anything from the vampire's point of view? No. Anything where guys... send in naked pictures of their chicks? You should get a job. The only thing I was ever good at... was bus driving... and now I need a piece of paper to do that. So get that piece of paper. I tried! Oh, Lord, how I did try. Knock it off!. I can't hear myself think. I want some peanuts. That's better. How come you never play your guitar anymore? I'll tell you the truth. I wasn't good at it, so I quit. I hope you're not mad. Son, come here. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet... next to your shortwave radio... your karate outfit, and your unicycle... and we'll go inside and watch TV. What's on? It doesn't matter. Open up! Open up! I got to go, and no fooling. Hey, Pop-N-Fresh! You're supposed to giggle. Gyyaaagh!! That guy has got to go. I know how you feel... but he is good with the kids. So the lady drove faster, but the strange car... kept banging into her from behind. So, finally, she swerved off the road... into the woods... and lost the other car... and that's when she realized... the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her. No-- He was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat! Did the maniac kill her? Natch. You know how I know? How? Because... I was that maniac. Hey, I was just kidding. That's it. He's out of here. But we're the only family he's got. This is not Happy Days, and he is not the Fonz. Hey-y-y, Mr. S. Listen, you drain-clogging, last-cookie-eating... collect-call-getting sponge. I want you out of my house. Heavy. What will you do, Otto? Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of money out there... for a guy who knows how to fake his own death. Before you do that... maybe you should take the driving test again. I can't pass that thing. I got a zero last time. This time I'm hung over. You can do it. You're the coolest adult I ever met. Wow. I've never been called an adult before. I've been tried as one, but... I'll do it. "Alcohol increases your ability to drive." False?! Oh, man! I don't know about this, Bart dude. Your dad is right. I am a bum. He didn't call you a bum. He called you a sponge. Sponge?! Does this look like something a sponge would do?! I'll show him... who's a sponge. Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout. I want to take the test again. Why? So I can staple my license... to Homer Simpson's big bald head! Really? Well, here's your written test. I'll get you started. "B," "C," "D," "A," "B..." Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days. It wasn't little either. It was a chicken wing. Wing! Ooh, what was that? It doesn't matter. Let's get some margaritas. I'm buying. Otto! That's what my driver's license says. Yes, hail to the bus driver... bus driver man. 
#03x23 - Bart's Friend Falls in Love^Why, you little..! [ Raiders ofThe Lost Ark Theme Playing ] What the..? D'oh! Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted. Cool-- An oversize novelty billiard ball. You shake it up and it tells the future. Really? Uh-huh. Will I pass my English test? "Outlook not so good." Wow, it does work! Let me try. Will... I get beat up today? "All signs point to yes." That ball knows everything. I got one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair in our ears? Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day? What could come between two bestest buddies like us? Samantha, I've always been suspicious of transfer students. Other principals unload problem cases that way. Lord knows I do. I'm a good student. Yeah, sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead, they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, let's just see what the permanent record has to say. No detention, fairly good attendance... I see you beat that bed-wetting problem. Don't worry. They'll forget... just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for I 8 agonizing months. Every night I wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates. Bart, was this thing right about your test? To those who doubt the Magic Eight Ball's power I say, behold my "F." Attention, class. I have a new student for you. Great.Just keep packing them in, Seymour. We should discuss this later. It's never easy to come to a new school. Let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky. Stanky. Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, good-bye. I'm sure this is a little scary for you... Uh-huh. So why don't you tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise. We just moved here from Phoenix. My dad's in home security. He came here because of the high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to but I'm not. It takes about six weeks. Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie? Sure. Eww! Victim number four. Louis, can I interest you in a wet willie? Sure... aah! When I find out who hit me with ball I'm going to tear them a new..! Whoa! In order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth-talking lothario with a car and tight jeans I will now show a short s*x education film. Ezekiel and lshmael in accordance with your parents' wishes you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls. Hello. I'm actor Troy McClure. You kids might remember me from such educational films as Lead Paint: Delicious But Deadly and Here Comes The Metric System. I'm here to provide the facts about s*x in a frank and straightforward manner. And now, here's... This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago he noticed his voice was changing he had terrible acne and had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny. Boring. Fluffy and Fuzzy went to the park the ice cream social the boat show and other wholesome activities and they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married. That night came the honeymoon. Eww! She's faking it. The most satisfying part was knowing that they waited. Nine months later Fluffy gave birth to I 4 beautiful bunnies. Eight survive. And now that you know how it's done... don't do it. Any questions? Mrs. Krabappel how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel? Because Mr. Krabappel chased something fluffy down a rabbit hole. How do we know when we fall in love? Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone. How do I create a half man, half monkey-type creature? I'm sorry, that would be playing God. God, shmod-- I want my monkey man. Uh... that's a nice dress. My dad makes me wear it. I hate it. I hate it too. Uh... can I walk you home? Okay. Everybody on. No shoving. Just kidding. You can shove all you want. Hey, Otto Man, you can't leave. Milhouse isn't here yet. No time, Bart Dude. My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar from 4:1 5 to 4:20. Hey, Bart. Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise. Hi. What's with the skirt? I've brought friends to this tree house before. But never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude? Maybe I should go. No, you can stay. You can read comics with us. Let's see, something for the lady... ah-- Radioactive Man vs. The Swamp Hag. Got any girl comics like Bonnie Crane, Girl Attorney Punkin and Dunkin, the Twinkle Twins or Li'l Knee Socks? No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics. Eww! You guys want to see something gross? [ Announcer] Tonight on Smartline:: "I'm okay. You're too fat." Here's your host, Kent Brockman. Good evening. Did you know that 34 million american adults are obese? That excess blubber could fill two-fifths of the Grand Canyon. That may not sound impressive but keep in mind, it is a very big canyon. This sucks. Where's that channel changer? Oh. I'll give it a chance. Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man-- Dom DeLuise Alfred Hitchcock, and, of course Santa Claus. But in real life Santa would be suffering from gall stones hypertension, impotence, and diabetes. I wish they had never invented fried cheese. We got to widen the hole. Hurry-- The chain's starting to give. We take I 8 ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham, and a fried egg. We call it the Good Morning Burger. I've got to help him. Okay, Milhouse I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel. Deal. Next, your Mickey Mantle for my picture of Homer on the couch. Milhouse, I've got to go. My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined. Well, you kind of sort of are. Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing? It's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waiting to kiss. You know, like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little for it to melt? But she doesn't melt. Oh, yes, she does. We start with pure milk chocolate... Chocolate... ...add a layer of farm-fresh honey... Oh, sweet. ...then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar... and dip it in rich creamery butter. What if I told you you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger? I'd say you're a lying scumbag. Why, sweetie? According to Eternity magazine you can lose weight subliminally. An idea is subtly implanted in your head without your knowing it. That's a load of rich creamery butter. You listen to tapes while you sleep. As you hear New Age music a powerful message goes to your brain telling you to eat less. Lose weight and listen to New Age music? Wow. What do you think, Marge? Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are. Lisa, what's that number? I'd like to place an order for my husband. Would he like to lose weight, stop smoking learn the state capitals, master hostage negotiations..? Hmm... hostage negotiations. Listen, Tabbouleh, we're ignoring all your demands. What do you say to that? Give me the weight loss tape. We're out of "Subliminally Slim." Uh... send them the vocabulary builder. Here you go, fatso. So long, stomach. We've had a lot of great memories. Hello. This is Dr. Marvin Monroe. Let's build your vocabulary. Abattoir: Slaughterhouse. "The cow was slaughtered in the abattoir." Has the weight loss tape reduced your appetite? Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety. Don't you usually play with Milhouse? He has a girlfriend. Milhouse? Yeah. All they do is kiss. How cute. They don't open their mouths, do they? No. How cute. Hey, Martin. No one has sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by 20 minutes. I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl. I'm as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps. Yeah, right. Do you want to do something after school? It's a date. Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we friends. Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute? Uh... sure. Is that tape working? You ate three desserts tonight. Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of twinkies overwhelmed my resolve. There's another thing I want to talk about. Tut, tut, gentle Marge. Here in the boudoir the gourmand metamorphosizes into... the voluptuary! What in God's name are you talking about? Oh. Mmm... Heh... Hey, guys. Wow, that really took my mind off those awful, transforming space mutants. Good. Man, I could sure go for a snack. Me too. D'oh! Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't we go spit on the principal's car? Listen, Bart, there's such a thing as spending too much time together. Oh, fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out. Bart, wait. Yeah? Uh... could we still use your tree house? What? Get bent. If her father catches us, he'll kill her. All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house. Thanks, Bart. ♪ Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ About to lose their privacy ♪ Now there's a Machiavellian countenance. Ooh, a sextet of ale! Hello, Mr. Stanky? I have shocking news about Samantha. Who am I? Let's just say I'm concerned prude with lot of time on his hands. I bet you had peanut butter for breakfast. Yeah. Samantha! Dad! Noooooo! Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just tell me what happened. Milhouse and I... That's enough! I'm putting you in an all-girl school. You're never going to see that boy again. Milhouse! Samantha! Well, 'tis better to have loved and lost... yatta, yatta, yatta. Let's go to the arcade. How could this happen? We started out like Romeo and Juliet but it ended up in tragedy. Hierospacy: Predicting the future through the study of animal entrails. Dad! Do you know what today is? The vernal equinox? No, it's two weeks since you got that weight-loss tape. Let's get you on the scale. You've gained I 3 pounds. Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery-- A pox on them! There stands a broken man. It's recess everywhere but in his heart. Hey, Bart, according to this magazine in another million years man will have an extra finger. Five fingers? Ooh-- Freak show! Lise, I need some advice and mom's not here. What about dad? I couldn't understand what he was saying. I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know. According to Eternity magazine the feeling of guilt has been linked to gamephenomene. Dow Chemical is developing a minty gel to eliminate excess guilt but it won't be on the market for six months so I guess you'll have to confess to Milhouse. Bart, I'm glad you're here. Milhouse could use a friend like you. Milhouse? Bart, I don't want you to see me cry. Oh, come on. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over. Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time. Milhouse, I got a confession to make. I'm the one who narc'ed on your kissing. What?! Milhouse is out bed and full beans. Whoa, it's a miracle! I bet the eight ball didn't see that one coming. Yeah. Marge... where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food? You mean, a spoon? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, this is good. Are you sure you want to do this? I can't stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces. How are we going to find her? She's wearing a plaid jumper. Milhouse! Samantha! I went to Circus of Values and bought you a ten-gallon tub of gummi bears. I'm sorry about getting you thrown in the penguin house. That's all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian's. It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They're very nice except they never let me out. Samantha, ne pas des boys. I have to go now, Milhouse. I'd better not. It's 50 rosaries a kiss. Oh, okay. Oh, what the heck. Bart think I can ever find another one like her? You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now, let's go whip donuts at old people.
#03x24 - Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?^Forgot there was a physical today, huh? Yeah. Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear? Nah. This can't be right. This man has I 04% body fat. Hey, no eating in the tank. Go to hell. How was your day at work, dear? Oh, the usual-- stand in front of this. Open that. Pull down this. Bend over. Spread apart that. Turn your head that way. Cough. Sir, I'm afraid... Homer Simpson is sterile. Who? A cabbagehead from sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample. Eww. Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample. Oh, yes. I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason. He could sue for millions. Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers! Let me make one thing clear. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me, you're all vipers. You live on personal injury, on divorces. You live on pain and misery! But I'm rambling. Anybody want coffee? I'll have coffee. Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart. It's so hard to listen. I hate you all so much! I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue. If you offer Mr. Simpson a couple thou... he'll be so dazzled... he'll sign anything you shove under his nose. Oh, a cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you buttoned-down maggot! You have cream? Yes. Where are my manners? Yeah, I used to be rich. I owned Mickey Mouse massage parlors. Then those Disney sleazeballs shut me down. I said, "I'll change the logo-- put Mickey's pants on." Some guys you just can't reason with. I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was giving them Japanese names. You ever drive a Tempura hatchback? Oh, yeah. Sure. I got hit by one of those. Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long-lost half brother. Homer? Herb? I let him design a car that would... make or break my company. Presenting the Homer. I'm ruined! Forbes called it: Overblown, don't you think? What about New Coke? Hey! I invented that. Yeah, but all that's in the past... because this is America, and in America... you're never finished as long as you've got a brain... because all a man really needs is an idea. Well, I'm licked. Me too. Now, the next event... in our living room Olympics-- the controversial couch vault. I do this for Stainmaster carpets... proud sponsor of the living room Olympics. What the hell are you..? Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat-- The dream is over. Who did this? We were sitting on the couch... when we heard a creaking noise. We leapt off just in time to see it collapse. There, there. You're safe now, little sister. Why did this have to happen now during prime time... when TV's brightest stars come out to shine? Oh, good-bye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories. That's right. I shotJ.R. Except for huge gaps in the western states... Hands Across America was a complete success. Well, I never thought I'd see it. They're dancing on the Berlin Wall. These live and lively lovers of liberation... Boring. Sorry I ruined your date, Sergeant Carter. Pyle! Well, friend, you're going back where you came from-- the curb in front of Flanders's house. Now, let's see. I need an idea. Idea... idea! What's the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas. What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home? Lady, you just gave me... the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you? Don't hurt me. Consider it done. Hey, pal, I heard about the couch. Yeah, you going to be okay? Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse. That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse. Simpson, report to Mr. Burns's office. D'oh! Is this the one with the lazy sperm? Mm-hmm. Ah, Simpson, you big, virile son of a gun... would you like a check for $2,000? Would I! All you have to do... is sign this form. I'm not signing anything until I read it... or somebody gives me the gist of it. Ooh. All right. Well, it just explains that you've... won--yes, that's it-- won the first annual... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... Outstanding Achievement in the Field of... Excellence. Don't I get some kind of trophy? And a big awards ceremony? Yes. That was Bonita DeWolf... and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft-shoe Society. This is the biggest farce I ever saw. What about the Emmys? I stand corrected. And now, to present the award... here's former heavyweight champion... Smokin'Joe Frazier. Webster's Dictionary defines excellence... as "the quality or condition of being excellent." And now the winner... of the first annual Montgomery Burns Award... for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence. Please, please... You know you won. Don't jinx it. The winner: Homer Simpson. Oh, my God! I win! Keep those pickled eggs coming. You cleaned me out. What's the matter, Homer? Cummerbund tight? I miss my couch. I know how you feel. You lost the couch. I lost the heavyweight championship. Heavyweight championship. There's three of those. That couch was one of a kind. I know things are tough now... but one day, you'll be walking along... and see a piece of furniture... you can love just as much. Hey, Frazier, shut up! You been riding my back all night. Oh, yeah? Care to step outside? Let's do it. I think I'm going to take a walk. All right! A peanut. I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea... and I've got an idea. Then how come you're still a bum? All right. A man needs two things-- an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what's this? Hmm. Any of you guys know... which freight goes to Springfield? Uh-uh. No. No. That's the one! I feel so empty, so alone, so couchless. Wow! The Spinemelter 2000. Give me full power. But, sir... Damn it! I said full power. Dad? Dad? I'll take it. This chair is $2,000. We can buy a whole living room set for that. There's an empty spot inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion... community service, but those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer. We can't just spend this money... on some creature comfort. All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky. Hmm... Yes? Oh, sorry, I must have the wrong house. That's where you're wrong, friend. Today's our tithe day... and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in, my friend. Let us feed and bathe you. Hey, wait a minute. Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet? I think it's Mom's turn, son. Oh, no fair. Thanks for the suit. If you ever want to spend the night... Maude and I can sleep on card tables. They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf. What am I going to say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them? Herb? Uncky Herb! Bart! Lisa! I'm so glad to see you. You weren't so glad to see me. I'm sorry, but I'm still mad at you. Every word you say makes me want to punch you. In my home, could you just kick me in the butt? I'll try, but I'm not making any promises. Herb! How have you been? I've been living in a cardboard box... sleeping on grates, eating out of Dumpsters. You? Can't complain. Let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode. On, off. On, off. He knows how to work a light switch. Oh, yeah, right. I don't know what this switch does. This is really good, Marge. I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Council. They do good work. Uncky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy... who will most likely become a bum like yourself? Discarded pizza boxes... are an inexpensive source of cheese. Lisa, aren't you happy to see me? Why didn't you write? What would I say? "Dear Lisa, last night... I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop"? I see your point. Maggie, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. You're going to make me rich again. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue. And while on Ventnor Avenue... you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly... to park your thimble. There is the unpleasant matter of the bill. Get to the point. 1 I 50 bones. That's all I got. Broke again, eh, Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman. Maybe we should play another game. Why are we playing games... when we got two grand in the bank? Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award. We should invest in a set... of "Great Books of Western Civilization." Look at this ad from New Republic for Kids. "Each month, a new classic will be delivered. Paradise Regained, Martin Chuzzlewit... or Herman Melville's twin classics, Omoo and Typee." Marge, didn't you want that vibrating chair? That was your idea. We should get a machine gun. We could hunt game, spell out things... or ring in the new year. I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer. How would you like to spend $2,000 to give a broken man a second chance? Nah. What are you talking about? Not here. Come into the dining room. I have a 20-minute presentation... that will change the world. 20 minutes? Oh... Okay, now before I tell you about my idea... I'd like to show you this. It's drinking the water! Take it easy, Homer. This is an example... of how one little idea, carefully marketed-- This is the greatest invention in the world. You'll make a million dollars. No, that invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example. It's going back for more. Oh... Homer, this is my invention. Now of course, with these blueprints... you'll have to use... your imagination. What the-- Hmmm. It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch... the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around in plain English... exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from "change me" to "turn off that damn Raffi record." That's a very clever idea. All I need is a couple of thousand dollars... to build a prototype. You'll have your money back... in 30 days, I swear. We owe a debt to Uncky Herb. He took us in and Dad destroyed him. Some shyster will bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother. I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks... but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother. No. Then give me... the drinking bird. What could you be saying? Nothing downstairs. You just took a nap. "I want to suck your nose." Hooga-booga, hooga-booga. "I'm scared." Hmm... The amplitude of the sine wave... is insufficient for "burp me" and this sawtooth formation seems to... Blah! Eureka. Now, I bet you're all wondering... what lies under this sheet. No. We peeked while you were in the john. Oh. Well, here it is again... my baby translator. Ooh! Marge, you don't have to humor me. Well, it's pretty ingrained. What do you think, Homer? This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew 2,000 bucks on it... when right now... rollers could be kneading my buttocks. Could you stop thinking about your ass? I try, but I can't. Lavish attention on me... and entertain me. Oh, Maggie, you talked! You see? It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind. Maggie. Maggie. Where did you go? Peekaboo! Oh, there you are. Very amusing. Homer, now what do you think? I don't know, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product... and put a clock in it. Homer, every mother in the country... will want one of these. I have soiled myself. How embarrassing. I gave Herb all my money... and he still treats me like something he dug out of his ear. He can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother. When is he going to act like it? This radio-controlled plane... gives your baby the chance to fly... just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll, the loop-the-loop... and bring it in for the perfect landing. Oh, dear. My wife is going to kill me. I only want to eat candy. Then that's all you'll get. This leash demeans us both. I'll take two! I'll take a dozen! I represent... the Precious Baby Discount Stores. I'll take 50,000! I'm rich again! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Homer... here's a check for $2,000. I also wanted to give you each something... for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume... of"the Great Books of Western Civilization." You'll receive a new one every month... from Beowolf to Less Than Zero. Finally a copy of Ethan Frome to call my own. You're too young for that machine gun... but I'm giving you something... that will make sure when you're old enough... you can still buy one... a membership in the National Rifle Association. Wow! The N.R.A.! Can I get armor-piercing, cyanide-tipped bullets? It's in the Constitution. Maggie... who brought me my fortune... I'll give you... anything you want in this world. I want what the dog's eating. D'oh! I'll get you... something nice. Now, Marge... Herb, I don't need any gift. You're too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer... and sold the old ones for 50 bucks. Come on, washer! Oh, you stupid dryer! Herb, I don't think... there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me. Homer, walk me to my car. What do I get? It's not another punch in the face, is it? This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother, and I can do the same. That's it? That's it. I see your point... brother. Give me a hug... brother. All right... but I never really hugged a man before. Homer, I bought you the damn chair. Get out of here. Go on, that's enough. Get out of here.

Oop! [ Laughing ] just kidding. [ Yelling ] I deserved that. That doesn't look like her body. The torso used to be Dr. Ruth. Her head is on a pike in the Chamber of Horrors.

We want Miss Springfield! Hey, set me down at that boat show. I'm gonna be riding on a pack of cigarettes? Mm-hmm. We think you're the perfect spokesmodel for Laramies. It's part of our new campaign. Mmm, classy. [ Gasps ] You see, Lisa, it's been an unlucky year for Laramie. A lot of the people who smoke our product have been... well, dying. And we need young smokers to take their place. I don't wanna be a spokesperson for a cigarette company! But you're a role model To young people. And we're thinking of retiring Menthol Moose. [ Coughs, Spits ] Bless you, boys.

[ Grunting Continues ] Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out... and Amber Dempsey back in. But this glorified, crossing-guard-of-a-police Chief won't get off his big fat can. Is it okay if I open these potato chips? [ Groans ] Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered. Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield's pageant application. Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne. Yeah, and some dip for these chips or somethin'. Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield. She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today. Well, that's obviously the wrong footage. Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson... filled out the pageant application incorrectly. In the area under "Do not write in this space," he wrote, "Okay." If it wasn't for me, you'd still be queen. You must hate me. Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant? I don't know. Was I drunk? Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself, and I do. Really? Uh-huh. Will you remember this the next time I wreck your life? It's a deal. And now, my exclusive interview with His Holiness, Pope John Paul I. That's it. I cannot work under these conditions. If anybody wants me, I'll be downstairs at McDougal's. Call the weekend guy.

You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap-- What? I ju-- I mean, you know, Mr. Burns is so old-- How dare you! Whoo-hoo. Tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. [ Clears Throat ] Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find a little cheeky. [ All Gasp ] I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this, do that. Blah, blah, blah. I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah.! Destroy him. Blah, blah, blah. Look at me-- Ow! This party is over. [ Guests Screaming ] Oww.! Where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again. I'd like to believe that this time. I really would. Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father. Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged... but, please, don't deny the world your fat can. Don't worry, boy. [ Patting ] She'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday. I knew it. [ Burns Groans ] I knew it. [ Burns Groans ] Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns: King Arthur's Excalibur; the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain; and that rare first draft of the Constitution with the word "suckers" in it. Yes, yes, yes. So what? You want your bear, Bobo, don't you? Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! [ Groaning ] Resistance is futile. [ Grunts, Sighs ] Oh, God, how I want my bear. But he's gone-- gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him. Why, put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You're late! [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Bomb Whistles, Explodes ] [ Groans ] This is all your fault! [ Grunts ] [ Men Grunting ] You gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag.

The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable "wittle" bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now.

He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear's in danger. Yes, we'll send the eye. I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward, and then we'll make him double it. Huh? Hmm? Well, why can't I be greedy once in a while? Bobo. My beautiful Bobo. I promise I'll never leave you behind again. [ Clears Throat ] Ah, yes.

Maybe they'd rather listen to that War of the Worlds broadcast on N.P.R., hmm? Yes, Mother. Good. Now, you hold Maggie. I'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop. [ Sighs ] The subject of our first painting tonight is the most... foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to-- [ Muffled ] The devil. And next in our fall catalog-- we love this-- it is a vision in raspberry cream. [ Applause ] Ohh! Pure genius. [ Gurgling ] Oh! And now to make the leap from dreams to reality. Sorry, Homer. While you were daydreaming, we ate all the doughnuts. Well, there were a few left, but we chucked 'em at an old man for kicks. Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet! All right. Stay calm. Remember your training. "Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency doughnut. Signed, Homer." b*st*rd! He's always one step ahead. Oh! I'd sell my soul for a doughnut! [ Rumbling ] Well, that can be arranged.

Webster's defines it as "an agreement under the law which is unbreakable." "Which is unbreakable"! Excuse me. I must use the restroom. [ Door Slams ] Uh, Mr. Hutz? Homer Simpson, I have no choice... but to sentence you to an eternity of-- Wait! Before you send him to hell, there's something you should see. That's a photo of Homer and me at our wedding. Wait a minute. You got married in an emergency room? Well, Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding. Read the back! The back! Arr. 'Tis some kind of treasure map. You idiot, you can't read. Aye, 'tis true. My debauchery was my way of compensatin'. "Dear Marge, You have given me your hand in marriage. All I can give you in return is my soul... which I pledge to you forever." [ Murmuring ] We've heard enough. Your Honor... we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property... of Marge Simpson and not of the devil. [ Groans ] Yea! Whoo-hoo-- Ow! All right, Simpson. You get your soul back.

Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse... will teach you some manners. Ha-ha! [ Sighs ] At least now I can get some rest. Hidilly-ho, Bart!

Dad, do you notice anything strange? Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer. I heard that! It was the boy! [ Gasps ] Ooh! Punch! Eww. Dad, this is blood. Correction-- free blood. Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up. But you didn't get any on me-- Ugh-- Wh-- Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire. And even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place. You're probably right. Let's just go back. [ Gasps ] Satisfied? Big deal. It's no different from the basement in Grampa's rest home. Look! [ Gasps ] Oh, my God! [ Muttering ] Please, Bart. I've seen your stupid Shemp. Nyung, nyung, nyung, nyung! Yeah, I've seen your Curly too. [ Growls ] [ Screams ] I know I really shouldn't, but when am I gonna be here again? Whee!

That's our special night. What's so special about it? What's so-- Oh, I don't know. A little show called Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman? [ Groans ] Where're you going? I don't know. When will you be home? I'm not sure. Where're you going? You already asked me that. Will you bring me back something? [ Horn Honks ] Don't wait up. How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children? Have a blast, Mom. Rock the Casbah. Man's best friend indeed. Whoa. You look... nice. Tonight has nothing to do with nice. Tonight's all about-- ♪ Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows ev-- ♪ Oh. Sorry, Marge. Wrong tape. "Welcome to the jungle We got fun and games" "We got everything--" [ Marge Screams ] I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me. Don't worry. You'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers... and give you a makeover, Homina. [ High-pitched Voice ] Oh, that would be delight-- [ Normal Voice ] Quiet, boy. There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa? Sure, Dad. [ Imitates Whip Cracking ] That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out. Oh, no can do, Homer. I'm watching the game. Shave up not down, you idiot. Ooh, sounds delish. Let me just toss some jeans on and-- Wait a minute. Who is this? [ Ringing ] Well, howdilly dodilly-do. [ Line Clicks, Dial Tone ] Hello? Hello? Hellodilly-odilly? Fine. I can have a great time all by myself. Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a babysitter. Oh, Lisa. Haven't you seen Home Alone? If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation. You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a babysitter. Wait a second. Mmm. You kids do need a babysitter. Blast that infernal card. Don't give that card to me. Here you go-- No! [ Doorbell Rings ] Mr. Simpson, I was just going through your garbage... and I couldn't help overhearing that you need a babysitter. Of course, being a highly skilled attorney... my fee is $1 7 5 an hour. We pay eight dollars for the night... and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer. Three. Two. Okay, two, and I get to keep this old birdcage. Done. Still got it. [ Marge ] Oh, I've heard a lot about Shot Kickers. ♪ [ Country ] [ Grunts ] How come no one else's chair is doing this? Hey, baby. Feel like getting lucky? I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children. Thank you very much. Listen, baby. I always get what I want. I said no. Oh, did ya? Oh, I completely misunderstood. Please accept our apologies. Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name. Hey, guys! [ Fan Squeaking ] [ Squeaking ] Moe, get the darts. I wanna play. No. We're phasing out the games.

This is not a library. This is not a Kwik-E-Mart. What was it you wanted to show me? This. [ Gasps ] You're not gonna hunt me for sport are you? [ Chuckles ] Relax, Marge. I'd never turn a gun on a human being. My husband, on the other hand. Come on. You try it. No. I couldn't. Yeah.Just breathe slowly and squeeze the-- I hit it! I hit it! My cans. My precious, antique cans. Aw, look what you done to 'em. Well, it's getting late. Maybe we should call it a night. It's only midnight. Come on. I know a place. Whoa. Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates. Homer, stop that. It's just a weather station. [ Grunts ] Come on, Marge. It's fun to smash things. [ Laughs ] I smashed it good. You got real "purdy" hair. You know, Marge, of all the places we've been tonight... I think I like this one the best. Mmm. Me too. Look, you can see our houses. There's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney. Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers? As of this moment, Lionel Hutz no longer exists. Say hello to Miguel Sanchez. Mmm, maybe we should call it a night. Okay. I should get home to my daughter before that naked talk show comes on. [ Starts Engine ] Ah, young love. The old make-out place. Hey, a new weather station! I'll bash it good. Oh... it's just no fun without Marge. Ah, there's nothing like moonshine from your own still. Oh, Simpson. What are you doing here? My wife's having a girls' night out. Ah,just get one of those inflatable women. But make sure it's a woman though. 'Cause one time I-- [ Stammering ] Come on. I'll, uh-- I'll give you a ride home. [ Groans ] I miss you, Marge. Huh. Their left taillight's a little smaller than their right one. I better pull 'em over. [ Siren Wails ] I think they want us to stop. Fat chance. This car's stolen. Stolen?

Marge, you're the levelheaded friend I never had. [ Groans ] We're in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair. A lot of blue hair? [ Giggles ] What a freak. [ Car Hits Bump ] Ooh! [ Screams ] It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal just because I didn't take her to the ballet. That's exactly how Dillinger got started. Really? I don't wanna be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up. Marge, it's a matter of principle. I just can't let that deadbeat win again. You're with me, aren't ya? [ Thinking ] I should say something reassuring yet noncommittal. [ Groans ] Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this. Once we lose the cops, I'll let you out. Well, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. These are professional lawmen and-- Oh, my God! It just disappeared. It's a ghost car! [ Tires Screech ] [ Grunts ] There are ghost cars all over these highways, you know. Hold me. Only if you hold me. [ Coyote Howling ] [ Shivering ] You can call a cab in there. Well, bye. I'm sorry about all this. But you gotta admit, we did have some fun. Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely. Hey. You're a good friend, Marge. Mmm. [ Coin Clatters ] This cross-country flight from the law would be hell if we didn't stick together. Hey. Friends stick together. It's amazing how through all this adversity, we managed to stick together. If there's one thing decent folk do, it's stick together. I hate it when the waffles stick together. Sticking together is what good waffles do. [ Groans ] [ Siren Approaching ] Thanks, kid. Marge, what are you doing? Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is-- [ Tires Screech ] [ Marge Screams ] [ Siren Blaring ] You stupid kid! You know that drives away all my business. See you tomorrow, loser.

[ Man On Radio ] All right. Your current location? Oh. Uh, I'm a-- I'm on a road. Looks to be asphalt. Um, aw, geez. Trees, shrubs. I'm directly under the Earth's sun... now. [ Man On TV] We now interrupt this program for a special bulletin. We've just received word of a high-speed desert chase. The suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of Springfield. [ Gasps ] Cool. I always knew someday Mom would violently rise up... and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors. Aw, shut your yap. At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty... and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion. Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women... leading to anarchy of biblical proportions. It's in Revelations, people! Look. We're only two miles from the state line. We're gonna make it. We're gonna be okay. My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield. That's it. I give up. A single mother can't win in a man's world. Ruth, that's a lot of hooey. It's not over until it's over. I'm sorry. I should've asked first. No, Marge. You did it. We really are gonna make it now. Oh, no! They're headed right for the Grand Chasm. Oh, my God! They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault! Marge. Marge! Homer? Look, Marge. I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car. I'm sorry-- Oh, well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point. You're right. I am lucky to have him. But, please, Marge, don't drive into that chasm! [ Together] Chasm? [ Homer And Chief Wiggum Screaming ] [ Thud ] Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill. Solid waste. I could kiss you. [ Loud Kiss ] Yech. [ Kiss ] Ew. [ Kiss ] Ugh. [ Kiss ] Ooh, I think this was pizza. [ Man ] Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court. Thejudge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges... and forced him to pay all back child support. Mr. Powers blamed the outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz. Lionel Hutz, a.k.a. Miguel Sanchez, a.k.a. Dr. Nguyen Van Thoc... was paid eight dollars for his 3 2 hours ofbabysitting. He was glad to get it. Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code Section 6 I 8A... wanton destruction of precious antique cans. She was ordered to pay 50 cents to replace the cans... and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish. Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army... neurochemical research center at Fort Meade, Maryland for extensive testing. Whoo-hoo!

I'm bringing back the-- You just keep right on driving. [ Grunts ] There we go. That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline. Yep, it's finally gone. D'oh!

You'll wake up old man Simpson. [Jimbo ] Hey, no more trampoline. [ Dolph ] Let's jump on the car instead. [ Metal Thudding ] [ Boys Grunting ] Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you all we'd ever do is work and go to church. That's not true. Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun. I can name I 0 things. Um... I made sloppy joes. [ Scoffs ] That's not fun. Kids, tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time? Um. Um. Well. Uh-- You should've called. I was very worried. We're on a tight budget here. Bart, watch your language. You are not going to perform that operation yourself. [ Groans ] See, Marge? I didn't realize people saw me that way. Are you mad? No, I'm fine. I'm going to my sisters' now. [ Door Slams ] [ Car Tires Squealing ] [ Ned ] Careful there, Marge. You almost nicked me. Well, your blood pressure is off the chart. And I don't like this urine sample one bit. You're headed for a nervous breakdown. You need Brad Goodman. His infomercial plays round the clock on Channel 77. [ Applause ] Thank you, Martha Quinn. There you have it. Unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities. She's one of my favorites. I loved her in the thing I saw her in. You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder... in the "feel bad" rainbow. Let's look at the rainbow. What's in there? [ Reading List ] Geriatric Profanity Disorder, or G.P.D. And chronic nagging, nagging, nagging, nagging, nagg-- Sorry. It does that sometimes. Nagging. Nagging. Mm-mm-mm. What up, Marge? I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives. Oh, hi. I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such self-help videos as... Smoke Yourself Thin and Get Confident, Stupid. Well, now I'm here to tell you about the only real path to mental health. That's right. It's the Brad Goodman... something or other. Marge, can I go outside and play? Shh. A few weeks ago, I was a washed-up actor with a drinking problem. Then Brad Goodman came along and gave me this job and a can of fortified wine. [ Loud Gulp ] Ahh! Sweet liquor eases the pain. And now I'd like to introduce the man who will put the "you"... in "impr-you-vement." Brad Goodman. Thank you so much, Troy. And, by the way, I'm not happy you're still drinking. But, at least you're down to one from more than 50. [ Applause ] Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications. Well, I may not have a lot of "credentials" or "training"... but I'll tell you one thing, I'm a Ph.D.... in pain. Now, let me show you how you can change your life. Troy, this circle is you. My God, it's like you've known me all my life. [ Applause ] Doctor, you've solved all my problems. [ Gulps ] That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive coculprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things... I just enable your life-script. And that sends me into a shame spiral. Exactly. So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun. Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies? Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad. Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now. I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame. And I feel that you hear my shame. I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance. I feel validated by that. Good. I'm glad we had this talk. Me too. [ Whistles ] Hmm? Hmm? Wow! For free. Surplus drums of mayonnaise from Operation Desert Storm. [ Gasps ] Brad Goodman is coming to town! Oh, Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman? [ Clattering ] [ Whooping ] Yee-haw! Yahoo! Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture. We know, Dad. I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend a self-help seminar. What an odd thing to say.

I have problems with-- I'm always interrupting people. Okay. Okay. Right now, I want each of you to try something interesting. There's no trick to it. It's just a simple trick. Now, close your eyes for a moment and really listen to that inner voice inside. Your inner child. [ Quietly ] Listen. What's he saying? Stay the course, Big Ned. You're doing super. Food goes in here. It sure does. [ Italian Accent ] Hey, Moe. Whatsa matter? You no talka with your accent no more. Mamma mia. Principal Skinner, let's try some rage work. I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother. Okay, I'll try. [ Chuckles ] Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel... right now. I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed, angry. I'm a grown man now, and I can run my own life.! [ Grunting ] [ Whispering ] Shh-shh. Calm down. Calm down. Moving. You can sit down now. We're still going antiquing on Saturday, right, Mother? You see, folks? We're all trying to please someone else. And as soon as you're not a human being... you're a human doing. Then what comes next? A human going! [ Laughter] Bart, be quiet. Son, that's wonderful. Come here. Come up here. What made you yell out that remark? I don't know. You just wanted to express yourself, yes? I do what I feel like. That's marvelous. I-I couldn't have put it better myself. "I do what I feel like." People, this young man here is the inner child I've been talking about. What? Son, you've never read any of my books, have you? [ Snorts ] Earth to boring guy. [ Laughter] [ Laughs ] I get that means no, huh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama? Papa? Could you come up here? [ Applause ] [ Man ] Yeah.! Thank you. Thank you very much. This is really remarkable. Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder... and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle-- I'm sure worn only for shock value. [ Groans ] And yet... they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son. That's fantastic. Oh, thank you. We can all learn a lot from this young man here. This-This-- Rudiger. Rudiger. And if we can all be more like little Rudiger-- His name is Bart. His name isn't important. What's important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity... with well-defined boundaries. [ Loud Snoring ] [ Laughter] [ Chuckles ] Isn't he-- People, I am excited. I can sense a change in the air tonight. You are all going to start living. Really living. [ All ] Yea! Living! Living! Be like the boy. Be like boy! Be like boy! Just the ladies. Be like boy! Be like boy! Now, the seniors in the back. We like Roy! We like Roy! [ Chattering ] This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers. And how. [ Laughs ] A new mood is in the air in Springfield... as refreshing as a premoistened towelette. Folks are finally accepting their feelings and communicating with no holding back. And this reporter thinks it's about-- [ Beep ] time. Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp... who taught us that if it feels good, do it. [ Gurgling ] Lise, today I am a god. Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich? Ew! [ Groans ] Now, instead of my boring old sermon... I'm going to take a page from the book of Bart... and do something I've always wanted to do. Take five, Mrs. Feesh. ♪ [ Ragtime ] ♪ [ Discordant ] Wait. Wait. I can do this. ♪ [ Resumes ] Wait. Wait.

Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass. Aw, man! [ All Spitting ] [ Cars Honking, Crashing ] [ Groans ] Lise, everyone in town is acting like me. So why does it suck? It's simple, Bart. You've defined yourself as a rebel. In the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted. I see. Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour photo, instant-oatmeal society. What's the answer? This is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest good-natured doormat? Sounds good, Sis. Just tell me what to do. Springfield will have its first annual Do What You Feel Festival this Saturday... whenever you feel like showing up. It'll be a welcome change from our annual Do As We Say Festival... started by German settlers in I 946.

If only Bart had been a better role model for everyone. That's not fair. The lesson here is that... self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities. No. Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery. That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.

I haven't been able to find a job in six years. Huh. And what training do you have? Five years of modern dance. Six years of tap. [ Brockman ] The economic slump began last spring... when the government closed Fort Springfield... devastating the city's liquor and prostitution industries. Now, at the risk of being unpopular... this reporter places the blame for all this squarely on you, the viewers. I propose that I use what's left of the town treasury... to move to a more prosperous town and run for mayor. And once elected, I will send for the rest of you. Boo! Excuse me, Mr. Mayor?

Some of the revenue... can go to help our underfunded public schools. Well, I like the part about the gambling. What do you think, Reverend? Once something has been approved by the government, it's no longer immoral. Yea! By building a casino... I could tighten my stranglehold on this dismal town! Yea! [ Belches ] Yea! Well, now. Are there any objections? [ Man ] Probably Marge is gonna have some. [ Crowd Murmuring Marge's Name ] Actually, I think it might really help our economy. [ Murmuring Excitedly ] Very well then.

Lift me up on your back, man. Whoo! [ Marge Gasps ] Bart! [ Grunts ] Cool! [ Chuckles ] He tried to kill me. I really think this is a bad idea. Marge, I agree with you in theory. In theory, Communism works. In theory. Look, he thinks he's people. [ Trumpets ] I think I'm gonna call him Stampy. [ Trumpets ] What's he yelling about? He's hungry. Here you go, Stampy. Eat it slow. It has to last for-- You ate it too fast. Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry. You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel! Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel!

Plants, eh? [ Squirrels Chittering ] Strip the bark now, Stampy. Hey, any more arboretums around here? No! [ Gasps ] That bird.! He's killing the elephant.! Stop him.! No, Dad, he's grooming him.

Look at these bills. ♪ Chain for elephant. ♪ ♪ Shots for elephant. ♪ ♪ Oversized decorative poncho"! Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little. Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance. You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1 ,000 a week. Then that's what I'll do, smart guy. [ Doorbell Rings ] Can we see the elephant? We'll pay you money. For the ninth time, no! [ Doorbell Rings ] Wait a minute. This gives me an idea. Mm, here's a better sign, Dad. I don't have time to read it. Just give me the gist of it, Son. [ Playful Chattering ] [ Grunts ] Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks. That was never five feet. That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered. Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat... and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels. Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl. [ Guffaws ] You guys don't understand Stampy. He's just like me. We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild. We don't take nothing from nobody.

[ Humming ] [ Customers Reacting Negatively ] [ Car Doors Slamming, Tires Screeching ] [ Vehicles Departing ] Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right? Yes, but we paid you four dollars. Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure... your bill comes to a total of $7 00. Now, you've already paid me four dollars... so that's just $696 more that you owe me. Get off our property. This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant. No, Dad, he's my friend. Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him. ♪ ["Mary Had A Little Lamb"] [ Roars ] Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya. I need a large African elephant, and I need it today. But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for. What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it? Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean. He likes peanuts. Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant. Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah. It's perfect, Dad. I only have two questions: How much? And give it to me. Well, we really can't offer you any money. We're a nonprofit organization. So, your bid is zero? Well, we'd like to think of it as-- Thank you. You know, I really think-- Thank you. Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair. Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory. His hat is ivory. And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory. Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy... than a guy whose ivory supplies are low. [ Growling ] We love... you. [ Meows ] Mr. Blackheart? Yes, my pretty. Are you an ivory dealer? [ Laughs ] Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network-- And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory. Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend. Don't worry, Son. I'll get you a new elephant. I'll take that one too. Done. I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy. Here's the keys. Elephants don't have keys. I'll just keep these then. Don't worry, Stampy. I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer. You and I are gonna run away together. We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south. Then, if I know my geography, it's just I 2 miles to Africa. Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through-- [ Grunts ] Stampy! [ Trumpets ] [ Gasps ] Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse. That's horsemen, Ned. Well, getting closer. Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone! Oh, my Lord! I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad. He took Bart too? That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't part! Piece of cake.

That elephant cost me thousands of dollars. Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer? I'd like it fine. Even if he killed you... and made your teeth into piano keys? Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene? Dad, you're sinking! Huh? Get a rope, Bart. No, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.

On the other hand... who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products? All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge. [ Both ] Yea!

Superintendent Chalmers... you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control. [ Screams ] Oh, I have had it! I have had it with this school, Skinner! The low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children! Oh, now I really think the children's appearance-- Seymour,you are in very, very big trouble. [ Barks ] [ Gasps ] Why, looking into this loveable mutt's eyes just melts my heart. Seymour, all is forgiven. [ Yelling ] Make way for Willie.! I said make way for Willie, ya bloated gasbag!

[ Hiccups ] [ Gobbling, Gulping ] I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left... but now all I have is this weird, hot feeling in the back of my head. That's guilt.

They let everybody out of school early just because you brought a dog? Well, yeah, but-- Well, I'm off to work. The dog has had enough excitement. But, Marge... dogs can never have enough excitement.

From now on, things are gonna be very, very different around here-- [ All Gasp ] with your new principal, Ned Flanders. [ Applause, Cheering ] Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here. As chairman of the P.T.A., I am de-didilly-lighted to take over... and I think I can put the "pal" back in principal. [ All Laughing ] Yeah, and I'll put the "super" back in superintendent. [ Someone Coughs ] It's the same exact joke. What gives, Leo? Now, I know everybody's eager to get back to class-- [ Mrs. Krabappel ] Ha.! but I thought it might break the ice if we had a little "Q" and "A." Dude, ask a question, or we'll have to go back to class. Um-- Yeah, you. Uh, yeah. Uh, I was wonderin', do you, uh-- What's your policy on, uh, lunch? Well, let me just say I want to put the "stu" back in students. [ All Laughing ] It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids. Now look what you've done, you little freaks! Young man, your gargantuan cone... is making a mockery of our self-serve policy. Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner... and I think he's gone crazy. He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything. Principal Skinner, um... I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired... and biting you and then getting it on with your leg. Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I-- I finally have time to do what I've always wanted-- write the great American novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park... where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques. I call it Billy and the Clone-osaurus. Oh, you have got to be kidding, sir. First you think of an idea that has already been done. Then you give it a title that nobody could possibly like. Didn't you think this through? ...on the best-seller list for I 8 months! Every magazine cover had it! ...most popular movies of all time, sir! What were you thinking? I mean, thank you. Come again. Bart, I've barely been here a-a good solid week... and you've been sent to my office I 1 times. Now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be getting in trouble every hour.

They don't need my testimony. Only because Mayor Quimby is buying his nephew's freedom. [ Sighs ] The system works. Just ask Claus von Bulow. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that Freddy Quimby is guilty... but that he is also innocent of not being guilty. I refer you to my expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.

I'd still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand... so that we can all bask in his gentle decency. He's wealthy, therefore, inherently good. [ Woman ] Yes, innocent. Mr. Quimby, did you assault Mr. LaCoste? Of course not. I love each and every living thing on God's green earth.

There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can. I'll pay you $40 if you think of it for me. No. Okay. 30. Good luck, Dad. All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.

I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like... put my heart on the line, and I make a fool of myself. Oh, boy. Oh, I'm gonna start bawlin' here. Hmm, why don't you come inside for a drink of water? 'Kay. Hmm. Clean house, no silverfish. Could've been very happy here. [ Knocking ] Homer. Moe. What are you doin' here? I, um-- Well, I-- I never touched her. Homer, I swear, I never touched her. Here's your water, Moe. I didn't ask her for no water. She's lyin', Homer. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I-- I didn't do nothin'! [ Glass Breaking ] [ Screams ] Bye, Moe. Homer, what happened to you? Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can: a bouquet of po-- ohhh. I give up. I don't deserve to live with you. Hmm. [ Table Bumps Against Wall ] Oh. My tattered rags... are caught on your coffee table. Oh, here. Let me help you. [ Muttering Softy ] Wait a minute. Wait, that's it. I know now what I can offer you that no one else can: complete and utter dependence. Homer, that's not a good thing. Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet... could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me... and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you. [ Sad Grunt ] But how do I know I can trust you? Marge, look at me. We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again. [ Sighing ] Oh. I must admit. You really do make a gal feel needed. Wait till my class hears about this. Kidding! [ Sighs ] Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family. I'm really glad you're back, Dad. I knew you could do it. Now don't screw it up. Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an "F." Hey, this is dated two weeks ago. Oh. Sorry. Here's a fresh one. And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight. Special present? I don't wanna wait. I want it now! I want the children to see. Ooh. Oh, right. Later. [ Chuckling ] So, Marge, are you really happy? Really? Hey, Moe.
#06x01 - Bart of Darkness^Well, you're certainly doing your job today, Mr. Sun. Oh, rats. And here we have the world-famous Beatles... exactly as they looked performing on The Ed Sullivan Show. I hardly think it's fair to be charged full price. I'm up to my knees in the original cast of M*A*S*H. Homer, my hat goes off to you. It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator. Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing. I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold. Won't this overload the motor? Marge, can you set the oven to cold? Ice cream! Ice cream! I'm all out of ice cream! It's true, you know. Ice cream! Ice cream! Fresh out of ice cream! Chili! Red-hot, Texas-style chili! And we got ginger ale. Boiling hot, Texas-style ginger ale! Texas! Face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck. I gotta replace that window. Pool-mobile? Pool-mobile? Look, Lis, I snatched five bathing suits. All Martin's. Take your best shot. I'm wearing 17 layers. I brought this on myself. Okay, little dudes, time's up. Everybody out! Time's up? So long, Lis. I'm gonna stow away underwater and go where the pool goes. Have a good life. Sorry, Bart, dude. We gotta fill this thing with Epsom salts... and jam over to the old folks' home. Oh, well. Same time tomorrow, Otto? No way, man. One day of summer's all we're budgeted for. I guess it is kind of a tease. Dad? Dad? Dad! Yes, Lisa? Dad, as you know, we've been swimming. And we've developed a taste for it. We both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. Now, before you respond, understand that your refusal... would result in months and months of: Can we have a pool, Dad? Can we have a pool, Dad? Can we have a pool, Dad? Can we have a pool, Dad? I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk. Over here we have the Hick Tub, the lnsta-Rust. That's the Lightning Magnet. That's the Tinkler. The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it. Is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in? Look, question lady, this job is not what I really do, okay? I play keyboards. All right, everybody in the pool! 'Tis a fine barn, but sure 'tis no pool, English. Is it a pool yet? Yes, Dad. Who could that be? Hello, Mrs. Bart. Is your pool ready yet? Bart, are all these children friends of yours? Friends and well-wishers, yes. Hey, Bart. Hi, Bart. Hey, my buddy, Bart. Hello, Mrs. Converdale. People! People, it's time we all discussed the pool-safety rules. Jump, Bart, jump! Jump, Bart, jump! You got it. Hey, Bart! Your epidermis is showing! It is? See, epidermis means your hair. So technically it's true. That's what makes it so funny. Pardon me a moment. Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt. I think he broke his leg. I said: Get this kid a magazine, stat. I'm sorry, that leg's gonna have to come off. Did I say leg? I meant that wet bathing suit. I'm afraid you'll need a cast on that broken bone. I'm gonna miss the whole summer. Don't worry, boy. When you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer. Isn't it amazing, the same day you got a pool... is the same day we realized we liked you? The timing worked out great, don't you think? Hi. Hey, guys! Sign my cast? Sign my cast? Guys? Milhouse! Hi, Bart. Faithful Milhouse. You'll spend the long, hot days by my side, won't you? I think I lost my glasses in your pool. I better go in and find them. But you're wearing your glasses. No, I'm not. Oh, look. Bart's all alone. Maybe I should keep him company, at least for a little while. Hey, come watch this. Lisa! Hey, look. Coming! Well, it looks like it's just you and me, Barty boy. Great. I get to spend the summer with my brain. What fun can you have in a pool anyway that you can't have in a bathtub... with a garbage bag taped around your cast? Traitors! Go on and have your pool! I'm fine by myself right here. You know, this isn't so bad. I'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted... with an old friend called television. Hope you enjoyed that, kids, because Krusty's out of here for the summer. In the meantime, we'll be running... classic Krusty. Enjoy! Good evening. Tonight my guest is AFL-CIO Chairman George Meany... who will be discussing collective-bargaining agreements. It's a pleasure to be here, Krusty. Let me be blunt. Is there a labor crisis in America today? Well, that depends what you mean by crisis. There's nothing like rising with the sun... for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool. Lisa, the blob has got me! Don't touch me or it'll get you too! Dad, you have to put chlorine in the water every day to keep it clean. Chlorine, eh? My face is on fire! Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him. Maybe we should spend more time with Bart. He's becoming isolated and weird. "I swear I don't know where the bombs are! Only the miners know that!" "Maybe this will loosen your tongue." "No!" Bart? Don't turn on that light! Sorry, I just came to see how you were feeling. I'm fine, just fine. What are you writing here, a play? No. "Cast of characters: Viceroy Fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..." Give me that! It's a work in progress. So. How do you like being Miss Popularity? Oh, well, you know, it ain't so great. Bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! Well, anyway, I brought you a present. Look, it's the telescope I won... at the Optics Festival. There was an Optics Festival and I wasn't informed? You go now. But... Go! What have we here? "The Lighter Side of Hippies." They don't care whose toes they step on. This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me. Do not be alarmed. Continue swimming naked. Come on. Continue. Come on... All right, Lou, open fire. Wow, the universe is so boring. I know. I'll use this to peer into Springfield's seamy underbelly. It turned out it was his evil twin. Grace, come here. There's a sinister-looking kid I want you to see. I'm never gonna see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk. That came from Flanders' house. Oh, my God! What have I done? I've killed her! It can't be what it looks like. This is Flanders we're talking about. I'll just watch some TV. Now, what you've been waiting for: Another long raga by Ravi Shankar. Shankar. Shankar. Groovy, man. This can't be what it looks like. There's gotta be some other explanation. I wish there was some other explanation for this, but there isn't! I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer! Then that's not the real Ned Flanders. I'm a mur-diddly-erdiler! If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework. Daddy, where's Mommy? We miss her. Mommy had to go away. She's with God now. Can we go there too? Soon enough. He's gonna kill Rod and Todd too! That's horrible... in principle. Look, Lisa. I found this change on the bottom of the pool. You can have it. Thanks, Nelson. Somebody took my juice money. Lisa, please join my family for a weekend in the country. There'll be hunting, charades... and ever so many delightful, romantic misunderstandings. Lisa, Lisa! Watch me! They're only using you for your pool, you know. Shut up, brain. I got friends now. I don't need you anymore. Yeah, I'd love to go to your house. My plan has come to fruition. Soon I'll be queen of summertime. Oh, king. King! Dude, buzz has it an even wussier kid has an even better pool than this. Hello? Hey, I'm stuck in here. I gotta think of a way to get out. Well, well, well. Look who 's come crawling back. Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife! But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt. I wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. Remember how you got Grampa tarred and feathered? Sure. That was 20 minutes ago. Gonna be in the tub for a while. Bart, I'm really sorry I've been ignoring you lately. I got carried away with being popular. But now that I'm unpopular again, I want you to know I'm here for you. You can start making it up to me right now. Flanders is leaving the house. I want you to sneak in there... and bring me some evidence! And something sweet. Bart, I'm not gonna break into somebody's house. All right. You're right. Let's just forget about that. Here, let me read to you from my play. "Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it Saint Swiven's Day already? 'Tis, replied Aunt Helga..." I'm going, I'm going. A human head! Of course. Oh, no. He's back. Flanders is back. Lisa, get out of there! No, Lisa, don't go upstairs. You'll be trapped! An ax! He's got an ax! I'll save you, Lisa! I'll save you by calling the police. Hello, and welcome to the Springfield Police Department Rescue Phone. If you know the name of the felony being committed, press one. To choose from a list of felonies, press two. If you are being murdered or calling from a rotary phone... please stay on the line. You have selected regicide. If you know the name of the king or queen being murdered, press one. I'll save you, cast or no cast! Gotta save Lisa, trash can or no trash can. Oh, no. That sinister-looking kid is coming to kill me. Help! Help! Oh, no. Oh, no. It's time to put you away. Put you away for good. No! What the gumdrops is going on here? I came to stop you from murdering Lisa like you murdered your wife! Murdered? Murdered? No, I've just been in the country for a week. But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with God. That's right. I was at Bible camp. I was learning how to be more judgmental. But I saw the murder, and then I saw you bury the corpse in the backyard! All right, it's true! I am a murderer! I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant... I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home. But I heard a woman scream. Well, now, that I can't explain. We found it, chief. Well, I guess that explains everything. Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife. I'm right here. Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic. More friends! More allies! More, I say. Hang those who talk of less. There's a few inches over here. My precious pool and its lifestyle accouterments. No! What a drag. I hear you. The gentle caress of a summer breeze.
#06x02 - Lisa's Rival^Lisa, will you keep it down? I'm making a crank call to Principal Skinner. Skinner: Actually, my refrigerator wasn 't running. You spared me quite a bit of spoilage. Thank you, anonymous young man. It's my room and I can do what I want. Oh, yeah? Well, I can do what I want in my room. [BANGING ] Bart, quit it! Bart: I can keep this up all day. [SIGHS] [SAX OPHONE PLAYS] Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Easy. Easy. I'm gonna need a bigger drill. [MOANING ] My, these seas are certainly heaving. Well, no more than your bountiful bosom, my lady. Does that earring mean you're a pirate? Kind of. The seas have quieted. And only in the sweet embrace of quietude can two lovers truly be as-- [SAX OPHONE PLAYS] Such noise! Well, I'm done for the evening. Huh. . . . Lisa, stop blowing my s*x. I mean, stop blowing your sax. Your sax. Stop it. Mom, I'm auditioning for first chair in the school band. . . . . .and I've got to practice. I'm sorry, but I sacrificed a very expensive camera. . . . . .just to get some quiet time. Fine, I'll play outside. Hey! Why, that sounds like Gabriel's trumpet. You know what that means, kids. Yay! Judgment Day! Forty-five seconds till pencils down. Lisa, what's the answer to number seven? Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat the purpose of testing. . . . . .as a means of student evaluation. My cat's name is Mittens. Three. Two. One. And that's pencils down. [GROANING ] Now, here's an oral extra-credit question. What was Christopher Columbus actually looking for. . . . . .when he discovered America? Lisa: Oh! Oh! Anyone besides Lisa for a change? Ralph, this better not be about your cat. Oh, all right. He was looking for a passage to lndia. Correct, Allison. And on your very first day in our class. And during a subsequent voyage, Columbus found. . . . . .the continent of South America. Yow-wee. I never made Miss Hoover "yow-wee." Hi, Allison. I'm Lisa Simpson. It's great to finally meet someone who converses. . . . . .above the normal 8-year-old level. Actually, I'm 7. I was skipped ahead because I was bored in the first grade. You're younger than me too? Are you hyperventilating? No. I just like to smell my lunch. I never met anyone who skipped a grade before. I'm surprised you haven't. You're obviously smart enough. Well, I'm sure I could have. But I'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends. Out of the way, brain queen! Hey, Sara. Well, I gotta go. I have to practice for band auditions. Me too. What instrument do you play? The sax. Me too. I'm going for first chair this year. Me too. Wow! We have so much in common. I'm sure we'll be the best of friends. Me too. Me too. Hurry up and finish eating. You're steering fine, boy. Hard to the right. Hard to the left. Cat! Deer! Old man! [SCREAMS] Jackknifed sugar truck! Sugar? Don't worry. Here's a quarter. Call for help. I'll keep an eye on things here. If only the sugar were as sweet as you, sir. That was downright decent of you. We hit the jackpot here! White gold! Texas tea! Sweetener. Dad, isn't this stealing? Read your town charter, boy. If foodstuff should touch the ground. . . . . .said foodstuff shall be turned over to the village idiot. Since I don't see him around, start shoveling! [SNIFFLING ] [MOANING ] Lisa: Mom? What? What? Why am I rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead? I don't know. I guess that's the school's decision to make. Did you talk to anyone at school? Make a few calls on my behalf? You could've been nicer to Principal Skinner, if you know what I mean. Lisa! I am nice. Homer, I appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange. It hurts my teeth. That's because I've loaded it with sugar! Marge, our ship has come in. I found 500 pounds of sugar in the forest. . . . . .that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound. But the store sells sugar for 35 cents a pound. And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it. Those are prizes. Ooh. A blasting cap. [TRUMPETING ] It's your turn, Jimbo. Someone's been practicing over the summer. Welcome aboard. Yes! My lute! Uh-huh. Lisa Simpson trying for first-chair saxophone. Very nice. Now Allison Taylor, also trying for first-chair saxophone. Oh. This is a very tough decision, girls. You're both very good. Well, I guess that clinches it. [CHILDREN GASPING ] That was a close one, Lisa, but you made it. I won first chair? No, you regained consciousness. Allison got first chair. Oh, it was just a dream. That was a close one, Lisa, but you made it. I won first chair? No, you regained consciousness. Allison got first chair. And believe me, this is not a dream! I need help. There's another girl at school. . . . . .who's smarter, younger and a better sax player than me. I feel so average. You'll always be number one to me. Hello! First born within earshot. I meant my number one girl. Oh, for crying. . . . Honey, if you get too competitive, you'll never be happy. No matter how good you are, there's always someone better. I thought I had the tallest hair, but that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes. But she's better than me at everything that makes me special. Believe me, honey. She's more scared of you than you are of her. You're thinking of bears, Mom. Hmm. [DOORBELL RINGING ] Sugarman! Door to door sugar? What a marvelous idea. Woman: Who's at the door? What's that, Mother? I'm just talking to the sugarman! Mother, I'm a big boy. I can do as I wish. Excuse me. Thanks a lot, Simpson, now I'm grounded. Hey, Allison, what's the answer to number nine? I can't tell you, Ralph. I can't tell you either, Ralph. Leave me alone. Brainiac! Nerd! You're such a geekazoid! Allison: Leave me alone. That used to be my face in the mud. I can't stand to see you so miserable, Lis. Unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. That gives me an idea. Note for later: Put rubber spider down Lisa's dress. [CHUCKLING ] Hey, I know! How about if I dig up some dirt on Allison? Remember how I got Milhouse on America 's Most Wanted? There he is on the monkey bars. Try to take him alive. Oh, no! Not again! [SCREAMING ] I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body. Suit yourself. If you change your mind, here's my card. Don't need it. You live in the room next to me. Note: Next year, order fewer cards. And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus. While you were out "earning" that dollar. . . . . .you lost 40 dollars by not going to work. The plant said if you don't come tomorrow, don't bother coming Monday. Woo-hoo! Four-day weekend! [GROANING ] Hey, I am above average. So what if Allison's ahead of me? There's no shame in being second. Man over speaker: And now Avis Rent A Car is proud to present... the second-best band in America. We welcome Garfunkel, Messina, Oates and Lisa... singing their number two hit, "Born to Runner-Up." [BOOING ] Why would they come to our concert to boo us? Lis, I did some checking on this Allison. And I know it's against all your moral fibers-- Give it to me! Hey, wait. There's nothing bad here. Yep. She's clean as a bean. But I did tip off the feds. . . . . .as to the whereabouts of our good friend Milhouse. But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything. I don't care. [INHALES AND SCREAMS] Milhouse: My glasses! Oh. I've got to stop being so petty. I should be Allison's friend, not her competitor. I mean, she is a wonderful person. Way to go, Lis. I mean, why compete with someone. . . . . .who's just gonna kick your butt anyway. I prefer my phrasing. It's great of you to come over. I really want us to be friends. You're a wonderful person. Hi, Lisa. I'm Allison's father, Professor Taylor. I've heard great things about you. Oh, really? I. . . . I'm glad we have someone who can join us in our anagram games. We take names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person. Well, like, oh, I don't know. . . . Alec Guinness. Genuine class. Very good. All right, Lisa. Jeremy lrons. Jeremy's lron. Uh-huh. Well, that's very good for a first try. You know, I have a ball. Perhaps you'd like to bounce it. What's this? It's for the school diorama competition. You're finished already? But the competition isn't for weeks! Lisa, we're talking dioramas. Who could wait? I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Edgar Allan Poe. See, this is the bedroom where the old man was murdered. And he's buried here under the floorboards. And, look, I used an old metronome to simulate the heartbeat. . . . . .that drove the killer insane. [TICKING ] Neat, huh? It's great. It's really great. [GIGGLES NERVOUSLY] Got away from you, huh? Well, you keep at it. Must protect sugar. Thieves everywhere. The strong must protect the sweet. The sweet. [SNORING ] Homer? In America. . . . . .first you get the sugar. . . . . .then you get the power. . . . . .then you get the women. Homer. Huh? Homer! What? Forget about guarding the stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid. Oh, am I? Am I really? Aha! Hello. Where'd you get your sugar for that tea? I nipped it when you let your guard down for that split second. And I'd do it again. Goodbye. You see, Marge? You see? When are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme? Never! Never, Marge. I can't live the button-down life like you. I want it all. The terrifying lows, the dizzying highs. . . . . .the creamy middles. Sure, I might offend a few of the blue noses. . . . . .with my cocky stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so-called city fathers. . . . . .who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards. . . . . .and talk about, "What's to be done with this Homer Simpson?" Look. Just get rid of the sugar, okay? No! Hey, get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad! Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow. Look, Bart. It almost killed me. . . . . .but I handcrafted all 75 characters from Oliver Twist. And now the coup de grace: A bitter snowstorm. Ooh. . . . Oh-oh. [CRASHING ] Is it okay? Well. . . . The important thing is that we survived. Who am I kidding? There's no way I'm ever gonna beat Allison! Bart: Sure there is. But it involves being a bit underhanded. A bit devious, a bit. . . . . .as the French say, "Bart-esque." I'll do whatever it takes. Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. Now, here's what we do. Tomorrow, when Allison comes out. . . . . .we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe. Leaving us relatively dry. Relatively? There's bound to be some splashback. Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition! Well, we could just sabotage her diorama. . . . . .humiliating her in front of the students and faculty. Perfect! Leaving her primed. . . . . .for the most dramatic hose-soaking of her life! Enough with the hose! Well, sure is quiet in here today. Yes, a little too quiet if you know what I mean. I'm afraid I don't. You see. . . . . .bees usually make a lot of noise. No noise. . . . . .suggests no bees. Oh, I understand now. Oh, look. There goes one. To the Beemobile! You mean your Chevy? Yes. Very clever, Simpson. Luring our bees to your sugar. . . . . .and selling them back at an inflated price. Bees are on the what, now? Simpson, you diabolical. . . . We're willing to pay you $2000 for the swarm. Deal! Oh, wait a minute. The bees are leaving. No! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh, what a world! [GROANING ] [SOBBING ] I'm sorry, Homie. It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets. . . . . .and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii. Diorama-Rama. My favorite school event next to Hearing Test Thursday. "The Grapes of Wrath"? I don't get it. Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath! Children: Yay! Yes, yes. Very good wrath. Let's see. Our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen. . . . . .Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I. . . . But this is just an empty box. I begged you to look at mine first. I begged you! Lisa, here is, as the French say, "Le fake diorama." I'll create a diversion and you make the switch. Hey, everybody! Whoa! Look at me! I'm over here! Turn this way right now! Hey, it's Bart! And he's doing stuff! Girl 1: I can't take my eyes off him. Girl 2: Look what he's doing. Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here! [IMITATES CROW] Our next entry is "The Tell-Tale Heart" from Allison Taylor. I can't wait. Be ready with the ribbon. Ew. What is it? It's a cow's heart. Them trying to make a monkey out of you. Allison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke? I didn't do that. I made a different one. Oh, is that so, young lady? Well, where is this phantom diorama? [SNIFFLES] I don't know. [HEARTBEAT THUDDING ] Have the guts to take the blame, girl. You're compounding your folly by lying. Right on! Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window. . . . . .not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom. . . . . .but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up. . . . . .and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead. [SNIFFLING ] [HEARTBEAT THUDDING ] It's the beating of that hideous heart! I mean, I think I hear something. Why, here's Allison's real diorama. It got misplaced, or so it would seem. Oh, well, that changes everything. Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready. Little sterile. No real insight. What do you think, Miss Hoover? [GASPING ] This has been a very disappointing day. All right, on to Lisa Simpson. You're a shoo-in now, Lis. After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win. Well, this doesn't deserve to win. What? Now we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry. Prepackaged Star Wars characters still in their display box? Are those limited edition figures? What's a diorama? Why, it's Luke and Obi-Wan. And my favorite, Chewie. They're all here! What do you think? It's lunchtime. We have a winner! I'm really sorry about what I did, Allison. It's no shame being second to you. Thank you, Lisa. You know, I'm actually kind of glad I lost. Now I know that losing isn't the end of the world. Hey, you still think we can be friends? Only if we're the best. I beat the smart kids, I beat the smart ki-- I bent my Wookiee. Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me and Allison to play anagrams? We take names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person. My cat's breath smells like cat food.
#06x03 - Another Simpsons Clip Show^Another Simpsons Clip Show. This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer, are you awake? This is important. Give me some sign you're awake. Wake up! What's wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire? Homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives? Wake up! Marge, it's 3 a.m., and I worked all day. It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent your whole Saturday... drinking beer in Maggie's kiddie pool. There you are. Thought you could get away, huh? Homer, young people learn about love from adults. We've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book. We shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom. How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon? It's a new episode. Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows. And it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth. Really? Ren & Stimpy do it all the time. Yes, and when was the last you heard anyone talk about Ren & Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you... but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love. No need. We already learned in school. This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago he noticed his voice was changing. He had terrible acne... and had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny. Boring. Fuzzy went to the park, the ice-cream social, the boat show... and other wholesome activities. They never ruined their fun... by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married. That night came the honeymoon. She's faking it. I mean romance, not love. Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney... homogenized and sold off piece by piece. That's not true! Romance is all around us, in our neighborhoods. Even at our jobs. All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories. Moe's Tavern. Hello, is Al there? AI? Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic. Let me check. Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Jock Strap. Is I.P. Freely here? Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Homer Sexual! Mike Rotch! Amanda Huggenkiss! Hugh Jass. Ivana Tinkle. I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt... and my butt smells and I like to kiss my own butt. No, no! No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is. Chocolate. Invisible cola. Forbidden donut. "Sacrilicious." Snouts. Free goo. Something. No, think about people... about moments in your life that have been very romantic. Oh, okay. That's not the idea at all. Okay. Well, this story isn't ideal. I've never told it to you before. I got a thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless. I went to the bowling alley to spite him. Or her. I'm awfully sorry. Entirely my fault. It is nice to meet you... Homer. No, no. Homer is my ball's name. I'm Marge. Your fingers are slender, so feminine. They're too tapered for this ball. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball. No, thank you, Mister... Brunswick. Call me Jacques. Jacques. Marge. May I ask you a bold question? Sure. You've never bowled? Never. No. No. Then I will teach you. I don't want to trouble you. Not at all. I'm a professional. Roll the ball, Marge. Let me see your form. All right. But I'm not very good. I can hit the one pin, but the rest of them don't even wobble. I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up. Now throw. But... Throw, damn you. You're a very good teacher. Here we are. You didn't have to drop me off. But I wanted to. Marge, do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight? Jacques, I'm a married woman. I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry, "Proceed!" Darling, I want to see you tomorrow. Meet me tomorrow for brunch. What's brunch? You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast or lunch... but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal. He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all. Your laughter is like music but if you laugh at what I say next, I will die. For I am about to say something very serious, perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again. That doesn't shock me. Away from prying eyes. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace. Marge, speak to me! Is Thursday okay? Thank goodness I drove down that ironic street. I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband... that's my idea of romance. Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacques. You can let him down gently... but over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off. Okay, Homer. That was a close one, kids. Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids... I have a scandalous story of my own. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new coworker, Mindy Simmons. She has a degree in engineering or something. Hi. How's it going? Oh, pleased to meet you. Yeah, ditto. Hi. Homer, what's the matter? Ain't you never seen a naked chick riding a clam before? Gotta go! I made it the whole day without seeing her again. I mean, "Hello!" I guess we'll be going down together. I mean, getting off togeth... I mean... That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator... I mean, elevator. Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy thoughts. Well, this is my floor. See you tomorrow! I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention together. TV's there. Bathroom's there. And there's your king-size bed for: Hubba-hubba. Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'll use this bed for is sleeping, eating... and maybe building a little fort. That's it! Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble. Mindy. We have to fight our temptation. No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service! Someone's charging room service to the company. Well, we'll just see about that. Fly, my pretties. Fly! Continue the research. Thanks for poisoning the planet, b*st*rd! Get bent! No more Chernobyls! Go to hell! I was doing my best to resist her... but at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom. "You will find happiness with a new love." This was a really nice night, Homer. Yeah, yeah. What's wrong? Oh, yeah, like you don't know. We're gonna have s*x. Well, we don't have to. Yes, we do. The cookie told me so. Well, desserts aren't always right. But they're so sweet. Homer... you know how I feel. So it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want. Oh, baby. This was a wonderful idea, Homie. What happened to Mindy? Yes, what did happen to her? She hit the bottle hard and lost her job. Good. Does anyone else have a love story? Yes, I do. And just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings... and scars that will never heal. It started, appropriately enough, with an innocent boy... being embarrassed on Valentine's Day. Poor Ralph. Here you go, Ralph. You "choo-choo-choose" me? Happy Valentine's. It was an unusually warm February 14th... so the children walked home without jackets. Can I walk you home, valentine? Sure, I guess. That valentine sure was funny. Glad you liked it. It says "choo-choo-choose" me, and there's a picture of a train. Yeah, nice gag. So... do you like stuff? The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of it. Well, here's my house. Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph. A Malibu Stacy convertible! "Look in the tunk." He must mean "trunk." Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show! It's the Krusty the Clown 29th Anniversary Show! Thank you, thank you! Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream? No, thanks. Send it this way, boy. Nothing gets chocolate out. See? Now, for my favorite part of the show... What does that say? "Talk to the audience"? Oh, God, this is always death. All right. Oh, no. Please don't show me with Ralph. What's your name, son? Ralph. And is this your girlfriend, Ralph? Yes! I love Lisa Simpson! And when I grow up, I'm going to marry her. No! Now, you listen to me! I don't like you! I never liked you! The only reason I gave you that valentine... is because nobody else would! Watch this. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half. And now! Lisa, not all romances turn out that way. Bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak? Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the tree house. She had something very important to tell me. I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend. You won't be needing this. Wait, that did end in heartbreak. Thanks for opening up old wounds, Ma. Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say: "There's a whole lot of frowning going on." Mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending? Of course. Remember when... your Aunt Selma got married? Good. Soon I will kill you. Wait, wait, that's no good. I know. Your grandfather, remember? It started on an outing for dinner. Say, I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll go out to dinner. I'll be back in a jiffy. That's not my mother. I'll be back in a jiffy. Can I come too? They hit it off right away, but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand. My favorite song. This is so nice. I can't remember when I've felt this young. I really can't. Say, sport, mind if I have the next dance? What the...? Don't sneak up on a... Aren't you...? No need for the blown gasket, Charlie. I'll have her back in one piece. But in the end, just when things looked worst, true love triumphed. Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man... to be your lawfully wedded husband? Oh, Monty, my favorite song. How did...? I specifically requested no romantic music. What...? Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier! Honey, are you sure you wanna be Mrs. Montgomery Burns? Wouldn't you rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson? No. I don't wanna be either. Hot diggety damn! That's good enough for me. That doesn't seem like a happy ending. That seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation. I give up. Did anybody learn anything about love tonight? Yeah, learned it screws everybody up. Well, there's that side of it. But there's also... Help me out here, Lisa. Sorry, Mom. I've decided to save my love... for someone who's guaranteed not to reject me. Soon, Cory, soon. Well, kids, I tried. But maybe you're right. Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject... but there was one time I got it right. Artie, I don't know. It was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it. Just this. Artie, please. Come on, kiss me. Please. No, really, I mean it! Now stop it! I'm sorry, Marge. Take me home. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I'm so respected... it would damage the town to hear it. Good night. Yeah, right. Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go! All right! All right! I'll walk in the mud! Homer? Marge? Yeah. You want a ride? Sure. When I got home, I realized who I should've gone with. Who? Hi, prom date. Marge, pour vous. Why so glum? I got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you... and I'll never let you go. Your first kiss. But not the last. Homie. See, kids? That's what I meant by romance.
#06x04 - Itchy & Scratchy Land^Itchy and Scratchy Land. Thanks, kids. Now I'd like to speak to you seriously for a moment. Yep. This week is the grand opening of Itchy & Scratchy Land. The violentest place on Earth. And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket prices in half. Kids, you heard the cartoon rat. If you haven't already run to your parents begging to go, do it now. You won't miss anything funny. I'll just be sitting here... reading this grownups' newspaper. Go now. Dad, remember how you said that going to Itchy & Scratchy Land... would be too damned expensive? Oh, everything's too damn expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got, 15 bucks. And talk about a preachy book. Everybody's a sinner, except for this guy. But now Itchy & Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in half. Can we go, Dad? Can we, can we, can we? Take it, Lis. Can we? No, no, no. Ask your mother. Mom, guess what. We're going to Itchy & Scratchy Land. No. I've already planned our vacation. We're going to the Highway 9 bird sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year. It's shaped like a diner. And it's on this really tall pole. Mom, Dad, Bart's dead! That's right. Dead serious about going to Itchy & Scratchy Land. You know, Itchy & Scratchy Land isn't just for kids. They have a place called Parents' Island. Yeah. Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over 100 bars and saloons... and a world-class chemical-dependency center. TV Town. Hammock Land! "Recipe-related bumper cars." Wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed. We have a big fight and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't gonna happen this time. Embarrassed? What do you mean? Well, our trip to the Amish country. Oh, yes. Hey, look, Marge. They're still not fighting back. I can be a jerk and no one can stop me. Even worse was our trip to Sandy Beach. Suckers. Sharkboy! This year I want us to do things together as a family. And get a lot of good exercise outdoors... so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation. Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us. Lobster hat, fishnet Speedo Jr., wheelie shoes... invisible-dog leash. Well, I'm packed. Remember, every morning, give a bowl of kibble... to Santa's Little Helper. Do you want me to write this down? No. I ain't senile, dad blast it. Okay, bye-bye. Bye, Grampa. Wait a minute. What was that last thing you said? Grampa's Little Helper? What's that? Which one of you is the mailman? Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever... or we'll all agree to disband and join other families. Agreed. The interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy & Scratchy Land. Don't worry. I've got an ace up my sleeve. Dad, can we stop at Flickey's? No. Oh, my God. What'll I do? What'll I do? What's the matter with you? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car. The whole trunk's full of them, Marge. Got any fruits or vegetables? Hey. Mr. Wimbley, it happened again. Now to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio. The book of Revelation tells us to watch for the seven signs of evil. Sign of evil number four... Continuing our sign-of-evil countdown, here's Vanessa Williams. Haven't we stood in five different states long enough? No. We better find a motel and stop for the night. We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all. Glad that wasn't us. North, south. Nuts to this. I'm gonna take a shortcut. Homer, no. You're gonna get lost. Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars, you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such. All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again. Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot. We're now approaching our final destination, Itchy & Scratchy Land. The amusement park of the future where nothing can possib-lie go wrong. Possibly go wrong. That's the first thing that's ever gone wrong. One adult and four children. Do you want to buy some Itchy & Scratchy money? What's that? Money that's made for the park. It works just like regular money, but it's fun. Do it, Dad. Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see. I'll take $ 1100 worth. Cool, that is neato. Oh, wow. Cool. Such a violent motif. Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children. There's no need to murmur, ma'am. Here at Itchy & Scratchy Land... we're just as concerned about violence as you are. That's why we're always careful to show the consequences... of deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify. When do you show the consequences? On TV, that mouse pulled out the cat's lungs... and played them like a bagpipe. In the next scene, the cat's breathing comfortably. Just like in real life. Hey, look over there. A brain burger with extra pus, please. Bart. Eyeball stew. Homer. We just got here... and already I'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior. I was just ordering a cheeseburger. They have violent names for everything here. Oh, I see. All right. I'll have the baby guts. Lady, you disgust me. Mom, that's veal. You sure she'll have fun here? Of course. Babies love the ball room. Torture Land, Explosion Land... Searing Gas Pain Land, Unnecessary Surgery Land. Oh, look. It's the 12 noon robot parade. Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the 12:05 parade. Wow, this is so much like my dreams, it's scary. Look at that cute little baby ax. It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp and probably dirty. Dirty, maybe. Dangerous, hardly. These are state-of-the-art animatronic robots. They have sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the guests. See all that stuff in there, Homer? That's why your robot never worked. This is just what I was hoping for, spending the day together as a family. You know, part of spending time together as a family... is spending time apart as individuals. Parents' Island? I'm sure we'll appreciate each other more when we meet up at dinner. Are you kids gonna be all right? Kids? It is the '70s. Right down to the smallest detail. Hey, the bartender even looks like John Travolta. Yeah, "looks like." Look at all this great stuff, Lis. Cool. Personalized plates. Barclay, Barry, Bert... Bort? Come on. "Bort"? Mommy, buy me a license plate. No. Come along, Bort. Are you talking to me? No. My son is also named Bort. Who are all these characters? You're too young to remember... the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy & Friends Hour. They had to have friends. There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam. Oh, yeah. They weren't very funny. I don't know. Disgruntled Goat had his moments. Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's, where it's constantly New Year's Eve. Here we go again. Three, two, one. It must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over. Please kill me. The babies look unhappy. Add more balls. Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy... loved and cared about almost all the peoples of the world. And he in return was beloved by the world... except in 1938, when he was criticized for his controversial cartoon... "Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors." Among his proudest achievements was the full-length musical Scratchtasia. Hey, Ma, I'm gonna get me a picture of this crazy critter. No flash photography, please. Roger Meyers' next full-length feature was the wildly successful Pinitchio. Now, you be a good Pinitchio, and don't you lie. I promise I will never hurt you. I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us. Wanna get a snow cone? Okay. So, Mr. Itchy, you think you're God's gift to women, do you? Don't do it, Bart. I just wanted to entertain. Can you believe I keep getting away with this? Officer. Mop-and-bucket man to the exit of the Nauseator. Another jumper on the roof of T.G.I. McScratchy's. We need more Bort license plates in the gift shop. I repeat, we are sold out of Bort license plates. I really wish they wouldn't scream. Dad? I kicked one of those... stupid Itchy characters in the butt. Yeah. There's just no way to resist it, is there? I want all five T-shirts to say "best vacation ever." Attention, Marge Simpson. Your son has been arrested. I'd be terribly embarrassed if I were that boy's mother. Attention, Marge Simpson. We've also arrested your older, balder, fatter son. I'm so embarrassed, I wish there was a hole I could just crawl into and die. Okay, throw her in the hole. Please. It was just a figure of speech. You've got to listen to me. Elementary chaos theory tells us... that all robots will eventually turn against their masters and run amok... in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting with the metal teeth... and the hurting and shoving. How much time do we have, professor? According to my calculations, the robots won't go berserk for at least 24 hours. Oh, I forgot to carry the one. I have nothing to say to you. But, Marge, I was a political prisoner. How are you a political prisoner? I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram? Oh, for gosh sakes. What now? Hey, look. This one's coming on to me. Mr. Robot. You're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend. Lisa, don't contradict your elders. My hair. You chopped off my hair. Oh, God, I'm ugly. I knew we should've gone to the bird sanctuary. I need the biggest seed bell you have. No, that's too big. A chopper. We're saved. Hey, you're the guys who didn't like our capering. When you get to hell, tell them Itchy sent you. Oh, my. It looks like we're doomed. Back, you robot. Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy. Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits. What are you, the narrator? Just keep taking pictures. I'll get more cameras! Smashy-smashy. I don't approve of that. Hey, mouse. Say cheese. With a dry, cool wit like that, I could be an action hero. Die, bad robots. Die! With a dry, cool wit like that... Who'd think that visiting... Itchy & Scratchy Land would be our best vacation ever? Yeah, best ever. Are you two bonkers? We almost got killed. Not to mention all the embarrassment I suffered. But, Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors... and we have so many memories. You know, you're right. This truly was the best vacation ever. Now, let us never speak of it again. As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank you... for stopping the killer robots. And to show my appreciation, here are two free passes. There are five of us. Here are two free passes. That's better. Man, if this is happening here... I hate to think what's happening in Euro-Itchy & Scratchy Land. Hello. Itchy & Scratchy Land, open for business. Who are you to resist it, huh? Come on, my last paycheck bounced. My children need wine. I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny... but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you. But it would be funny to someone who was watching us. No, Mom. He's right. Observe. Oh, my. Lisa, go to your room.
#06x05 - Sideshow Bob Roberts^[ Man ] KBBL talk radio. And now, Springfield's favorite conservative... and author of the well-selling book, Only Turkeys Have Left Wings... ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow. [ Intro ] Ugh! That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot. He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that? Yeah. Switch the station. I consider myself politically correct. And his views make me uncomfortable. No, no, no, no, no, guys. Now, I'm not very political. I usually think people who vote are a bit fruity. But for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me. Mmm! Mmm! Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Birch Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the 51 st state. You know, th-th-there are three things we're never gonna get rid of here in Springfield- One, the bats in the public library. [ Screaming ] Two, Mrs. McFearly's compost heap. [ Buzzing ] [ Cackling ] And three, our six-term mayor... the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking spend-o-crat... Diamond Joe Quimby. Hey, I am no longer illiterate! Now, why are we doomed to this Quimby quagmire, you ask, O Reasonable Listener? Because this town is under the stranglehold of... a few tie-dyed tree huggers who would rather play hacky sack than lock up the homeless. [ Groans ] This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house. I don't like him either, Mom. But I'm doing a report on local politics for my school project. You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um, I'm doing a school project on, uh... fireworks! [ Groans ] Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that. And now as a special send-off and a way to say... Gung Hay Fat Choy to our visiting Chinese principals... Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display. [ Children ] Cool.! Wow.! [ Sighs ] What a week. He promise a big firework ""dispray." Bad student. Uh-uh. Bad principal. Oh.! [ Birch ] So, my friends, let's just junk those dumb-o-crats... and their bleeding heart "smellfare'"program. Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else? When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station. [ '80s Pop ] Oh, I can't take this anymore! Let's switch back. [ Birch ] All right, my friends. Let's go to the phones. First up is Bob from South Springfield. Welcome to you, sir. [ Bob ] Hello, Birch. Longtime listener, first-time caller. Kudos for bringing the public back to the Republican Party. It's high time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny-hatemongers... and Charlie-Bible-thumps or even, God forbid... George Bushes. [ Gasps ] That sounds like Sideshow Bob! Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob yakking it up on the old yak-box. Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is. Whew! Sideshow Bob used to be But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery, and Bart got him put in jail. [ Homer ] Uh-huh. When he got out, he married Aunt Selma... and tried to murder her. Oh, Side show Bob! Bart, your mortal enemy is on the radio! It's time for more deeee-mentia with Dr. Demento! Aah! And now, the Funny Five- [ Panting ] I meant your other mortal enemy... Sideshow Bob. [ Gasps ] Sideshow Bob? [ Groans ] I'm only 10 and I already got two mortal enemies. And this proposed expressway will bring... increased commerce to all local merchants. [ Murmuring ] What's in it for us? Yeah, give us something we like... or we'll ride you out of town on a rail! [ Clears Throat ] Well, what do you, uh, people like? Sleep! Sexy dames and plenty of'em! Matlock.! [ All ] Yeah.! Well, uh, I suppose I could name it the, uh... Matlock Expressway. [ Cheering ] [ Bob ] But it would be terribly myopic of me... to blame all my current woes on one spiky-haired little simpleton. [ Birch ] Mm-hmm. Myopic, or to say the least, intransigent. Now, you mentioned some woes there. [ Bob ] Well, you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated. [ Alarm Blaring ] Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit. [ Scoffs ] Attempted murder! Now, honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Do they? Oh, really! Now, this is a personal call! Now, my friends, i-isn't this just typical? Another intelligent conservative here... railroaded by our liberal justice system. Just like... [ Crinkling ] Colonel Oliver North, Officer Stacey Koon... and cartoon smokes-person, Joe Camel. Well, I've had it! I am gonna make it my mission... to see that our friend Bob is set free. Nooooo! Well, despite Bart's objections... the people of South Africa can now vote in free, democratic elections. [ Birch ] My friends, Bob is a political prisoner. I want every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of jail. All right, you heard the man. One grenade each. Moe, I think he meant through nonviolent grassroots political action. Ah, geez. Really? You think so? All right, give 'em back! [ All Groaning ] Everybody, give 'em back. Hey, hey! Who pulled the pin on this one? Very well. If that is the way the winds are blowing... let no one say I don't also blow. [ Chanting ] Free Bob. [ Quimby's Voice ] By special order of the mayor of Springfield... you are hereby granted a full and complete pardon. Congratulations, Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. Boat's on the other side. Yes, thank you. [ Bird Cries ] [ Wolf Howls ] Hail, brothers! Coranon silaria ozoo mahoke.! [ All ] Mahoke.! Now then, gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us. And if we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby... we need a candidate with name-recognition and media savvy... a true leader who will do exactly as he's told. Monty, I'm way ahead of you. If you'll just open that door, you'll see the next mayor of Springfield. Nice. Very nice. What'd it say? No, no, no. Bob. Bob, come in. A fine mahoke to you all. Why, he's even better. [ Austrian Accent ] I agree. I like the human touch. [ Skinner ] Students, I want you to be on... your best behavior for this carefully choreographed media event. Now, this means there is to be no wising off, no face-making and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph! Yes, sir. Hello, children. Hello, Bart. Eep! Young friends... my opponent,Joe Quimby, is confused about your school system. Do you know what he does? He flip-flops! [ Chanting Gibberish ] [ Students Murmuring ] Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going. [ Laughing, Cheering ] He wants to sell your future short. [ Gasps, Cheering ] Hmm. Bart, we can't let Bob steal the spotlight. We're gonna have to stoop to the lowest common denominator. I can do that. [ Footsteps Approaching ] Aaah! Help! I'm being attacked by, uh, things. [ Bart, Lisa Giggling ] [ Murmuring ] Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have. More important than coal? Uh, eh, uh, yes. [ Approving Murmurs ] Oh, that was a big mistake, Bart. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. [ Gasping ] Duh, stay out of Riverdale! [ Chorus ] Without a Mayor Quimby our town would really stink. We wouldn't have a tire yard or a midsized roller rink. [ Women ] We wouldn't have our gallows or our shiny Bigfoot trap. [ Men ] It's not the mayor's fault that the stadium collapsed. [ Man Announcing ] Quimby. If you were running for mayor, he'd vote for you. Paid for by the Mayor Quimby for Mayor Mayoral Committee. Hey, four-eyes, vote Quimby. Hey, beard-o, vote Quimby. This time he's the lesser of two evils. Uh, yeah, yeah. I love ""Grimby." Uh, could I have some more bumper stickers, please, dude? All right! The mummy's ready for his mystical journey! Aaah! What's happening? That Quimby fella promised to build us... a Matlock Expressway! How you gonna top that, smart guy? Hmm, well, how's this? I'll not only build the expressway... I will spend the remainder of this afternoon... patiently listening to your interminable anecdotes. Hot diggety damn! Me first! Not many people know I owned... the first radio in Springfield. Weren't much on the air then. Just Edison reciting the alphabet over and over. ""A," he'd say. Then ""B." ""C" would usually follow. [ Sighs ] [ Man Announcing ] Mayor Quimby supports revolving-door prisons. Mayor Quimby even released Sideshow Bob... a man twice convicted of attempted murder. Can you trust a man like Mayor Quimby? Vote Sideshow Bob for mayor. The League of Uninformed Voters presents the Springfield mayoral debates. I'm your moderator, Larry King. Now a word to our audience. Even though we're being broadcast on... Fox... there's no need for obnoxious hooting and hollering. [ Hooting ] Ugh! [ Sneezes ] I shouldn't have shaken hands with those old people. [ Groaning ] I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there. Don't worry. He's taken a million of these capsules. [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Sideshow Bob, Councilman Les Wynan... says that you're not experienced enough to be mayor. Sir, what do you have to say about that? I'd say that Les Wynan... ought to do more thinkin' and less whinin'. There's no Councilman Les Wynan. Good line though. Mayor Quimby, you are well-known, sir... for your lenient stance on crime. But suppose for a second that your house was ransacked by thugs... your family tied up in the basement with socks in their mouths! You try to open the door, but there's too much blood on the knob- What is your, uh, question? My question's about the budget, sir. [ Groans ] Hmm, I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy. But I do approve of his Selma-killing policy. Well, he framed me for armed robbery. But, man, I'm aching for that upper-class tax cut. [ Grunts ] [ Murmuring, Shushing ] And the results are in. For Sideshow Bob- I 00 percent. For Joe Quimby- one percent. And we remind you there is a one-percent margin of error. [ Sighs, Groans ] [ Rapid Footsteps ] All right, let's go live to Bob headquarters now... for Mayor Terwilliger's victory speech. [ Laughing ] [ Kent Brockman ] And just look how happy he is. [ Machine Whirring ] [ Hydraulics Squeal ] [ Rumbling ] Aah! It's the Rapture! Quick! Get Bart out of the house before God comes! So sorry, Mr. Simpson. Your house is blocking... construction of our new Matlock Expressway. Now, I am a fair man. You will have 72 hours to vacate. At that time, we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons. Homer, we've got to stop them! I know what you're up to, Mayor ""Terwigager." And no one in my family's gonna stand for it. [ Horn Honks ] Move your goddurn house, Son! Bart, by special request of the mayor's office... you are going to be left back. [ Sighs ] You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade? Well, yes. But not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten. Kindergarten! [ Pops ] Ha! Now, boys and girls, who knows what this is? Triangle. Very good, Bart! You have first choice of toys for free-play. Cool! I call the Flintstone phone! [ Rings ] Yabba dabba doo! I like talkin' to you! [ Giggles ] We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls. I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes... and another convicted felon would get so few. Here you go. [ Exhales ] The results of last month's mayoral election. All 48,000 voters and who each one of them voted for. I thought this was a secret ballot. Meh. [ Straining ] Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Aaron L. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Arthur B. Ablablab voted for... Bob. [ Sighs ] Hey. [ Gasps ] [ Bart ] So whoever it is who wrote that note... wants to meet us here tonight? This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein. Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics. Stuck-up Riverdale punks! Think they're too good for me! [ Whispering ] You're on the right track. Follow the names. How the hell do you know? I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign. [ Tires Screeching ] [ Horn Honks ] Hey, Mr. Smithers! [ Scoffs ] Well, you might as well give me a ride home now. I've never gone behind Mr. Burns's back before. But Sideshow Bob's ultraconservative views- [ Groans ] conflict with my... choice of lifestyle. [ Clears Throat ] All I can do is give you one name- Edgar Neubauer. Find him and you'll find your answer. [ Sighs ] No Edgar Neubauer. This is hopeless! They're gonna demolish our house for sure! We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6. But Dad can't afford six dollars a night. Hey! Lise! Lise, come here.! I found Edgar Neubauer! Oh, my God! The dead have risen, and they're voting Republican! [ Gasps ] No, Bart! Don't you see? Dead people can't vote! Look! Prudence Goodwyfe. Died I 641 . She voted for Bob too. So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob. [ Gasps ] Look! Mr. and Mrs. Bananas. Humphrey Boa-gart. Oh, my poor dead kitty! Please, not you too! All right, Bob. Now it's personal! Hey! Um, he did try to kill me. Wh-Whoa! [ Crowd Gasps, Murmurs ] Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election? No, I did not. Kids, help. Oh, I don't mind. We want these children to feel justice has been served. That way, they can sleep soundly tonight... on their hard, feculent motel pillows. Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am. I have a plan. I think we can trap him. You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent. Indeed, I am. Because we all know you're a naive pawn- puppet if you will- of the most diabolical political genius... Springfield has ever known- Birchibald T. Barlow! [ Gasps ] [ Stammering ] You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you? You were just Barlow's lackey! You were Ronnie to his Nancy! Sonny to his Cher! Ringo to his rest of the Beatles! Enough! Lies, lies, lies! I did it! I did it all! [ Gasps, Murmuring ] There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards? We want the truth! You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! No truth-handler, you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities! Will you get to the point? Yes! Only I could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral fraud. And I have the records to prove it! Here,just look at these! Each one a work of Machiavellian art! Hmm, but why? Because you need me, Springfield. Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic. But deep down inside, you secretly long... for a coldhearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals... and rule you like a king! That's why I did this- to protect you from yourselves! Now, if you don't mind, I have a city to run. Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest. What? Oh, yes. All that stuff I did. Bart, we did it! Now we get to keep our house... and you get to go back to the fourth grade! [ Sighs ] Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with. The spoon, Bart. [ Gasps ] Of course! Oh- Someday I'll have my vengeance: Someday when I find my way out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool! Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie. Bob, come along! We need an eighth... to row against the Princeton alums. Princeton! [ Growls ] Stroke! Stroke!
#06x06 - Treehouse of Horror V^Hello, once again. As usual, I must warn you all that this year's Halloween show is very scary... and those of you with young children may want to send them off to bed and... Oh, my. It seems the show is so scary, Congress won't even let us show it. Instead they've suggested the 1947 classic Glenn Ford movie... Two Hundred Miles to Oregon. Bart: There's nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust your picture. We are controlling the transmission. Homer: What's that, boy? We're in control? Hey, look! I can see my voice! [SINGING] This is my voice on TV Bart: Dad, you're ruining the mood! Homer: Sorry. Bart: For the next half- hour, we will control what you see and hear. You are about to experience the terror and foul horror of... The Simpsons Halloween Special. Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there. Homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house? D'oh! Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there again. When you locked the front door, did you lock the back door? D'oh! D'oh! Oh, no! We left Grampa back at the gas station! What about Grampa? Hello! Hi! We're here! Oh, goody. The sea monkeys I ordered have arrived. Look at them cavort and caper. Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge. Yes, they work hard and they play hard. This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground... and was the setting of Satanic rituals, witch burnings... and five John Denver Christmas specials. Oh! John Denver. That's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor. Hey, I found a shortcut through your hedge maze. Why, you little... Willie: No, no. Go easy on the wee one. His father's gonna go crazy and chop them all into haggis. What's haggis? Boy, you read my thoughts! You've got the shinning. You mean shining. Shh! You want to get sued? Now, look, boy, if your da goes gaga... you just use that shin of yours to call me and I'll come a-running. But don't be reading my mind between 4 and 5. That's Willie's time! Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply... I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those lowlifes. Sir, did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this... that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families? Perhaps. Tell you what, we come back and everyone's slaughtered... I owe you a Coke. Hmm. Cable's out. Think I'll have a beer. Hmm. Not a drop in the house. What do you know. Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well. I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! Homer! Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry. There's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that ax collection. See you later. Mom, is Dad gonna kill us? We're just gonna have to wait and see. So, what'll it be, Homer? Moe, give me a beer! No. Not unless you kill your family. Why should I kill my family? Uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts. You don't look so happy. Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family, I'll give you a beer. Homer? Homie? What he's typed will be a window into his madness. "Feeling fine." Wow, that's a relief. This is less encouraging. Get out! Well, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of... No TV and No Beer Make Homer something, something. Go Crazy? Don't mind if I do! Stay away from me, Homer! Give me the bat, Marge! Give me the bat! Give me the bat! Come on. Give me the bat. Give me the bat... Scaredy cat. You stay here till you're no longer insane. Hmm. Chili would be good tonight. Moe: Homer, it's Moe. Look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned... the project isn't moving forward. Can't murder now. Eating. Moe: For crying out loud. Come on. No! Here's Johnny! D'oh! David Letterman! Hi, David. I'm Grampa. D'oh! I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on 60 Minutes! Hello, police, this is Marge Simpson. Marge (over radio): My husband is on a murderous rampage. Over. Well, thank God that's over. I was worried there for a second. No answer. Don't worry, Mom. I can use my shinning to call Willie. And that was the first time she'd ever flown a plane. Uh-oh. The little fat boy and his family are in trouble. I'm coming to rescue the lot of you! All right, loony, show me what you got. Is that the best you can do? Oh, my. I hope that rug was Scotchgarded. Must kill family. had been given rifles, but no ammunition. Fortunately, there was a hardware store. Lisa: Dad, look! Television! Teacher! Mother! Secret lover. Urge to kill fading. Fading. Fading. Rising! Fading. Fading. Gone. Come, family. Sit in the snow with Daddy... and let us all bask in television's warm, glowing, warming glow. Man (on tv): Live from Broadway, it's The Tony Awards. With your hosts, Tyne Daly and Hal Linden. Homer, change channel. Can't. Frozen. Urge to kill rising. You know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles. But sitting here now with you and the kids... in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country... it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy. Dad, your hand is jammed in the toaster! What? Bart: Dad! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off of me! Dad, it's in there again! No! It's stuck on my hand. This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools. There. Better than new. Now, to take her for a test toast. What the...? Look at that. I'm the first non-Brazilian person to travel backwards through time. Correction, Homer. You're the second. That's right, Mr. Peabody. Quiet, you. Homer: I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. Okay, don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day. If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything. Because even the tiniest change... can alter the future in ways you can't imagine. Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything... I won't destroy the future. Stupid bug! You go squish now! [GASPS] That was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right? Phew. I'm back. Aw, my loving family. Nothing's changed. Hidilly- ho, slave- a- reenos. All: Okilly-dokilly. Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV? I see by the big board we got a Negative Nelly in sector two. I'm gonna have to ask the whole family to kind of freeze... and prepare for re- Neducation. Don't you remember? Flanders is the unquestioned lord... and master of the world. D'oh! Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles. Just relax. Let the hooks do their work. What the hell are you smiling at? Oh. Now, in case all that smiling didn 't cheer you up... there's one thing that never fails: A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy. It's not so bad, Homer. They go in through your nose... and they let you keep the piece of brain they cut out. Look. Ooh, hello. Hello there. Who's that big man there? Who's that? Join us, Father. Join us, Father. It's bliss. No! Oh, no. They're gaining on me. Wait! I have an idea! These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape! I gotta go back, fix future. This time I'm not gonna touch a thing. Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it. Oh. I wish, I wish I hadn 't killed that fish. Hey, where is everybody? Hey, there's a bug that looks like Dad. Let's kill it. Okay. This is gonna cost me. D'oh! I mean, hey. Good morning, Father, dear. Hope you're well. Are we taking the Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today? Fabulous house, well-behaved kids, sisters-in-law dead, luxury sedan... Whoo-hoo! I hit the jackpot! Marge, dear, would you kindly pass me a doughnut? Doughnut? What's a doughnut? It's raining again. You're still not in your own world, Homer. I can get you home, but you have to do exactly as l... [IN DEEP VOICE] This is indeed a disturbing universe. Don't touch anything? I'll touch whatever I feel like! [SHOUTING] Foolish earthling, totally unprepared for the effects of time travel. What happened to us, Kodos? Quiet, you. Good morning. What's my name? What color is the sky? What of doughnuts? What? For the love of God, tell me! Homer, the sky is blue, doughnuts are plentiful, Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you? Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat. Eh, close enough. Hey, everybody! Let's all turn our desks backwards... before Mrs. Krabappel shows up. Yeah! Great idea! All right, backwards boy, back your butt down to detention. Over here, Simpson. The detention room is overcrowded, so you'll be serving in the cafeteria. Oxygen running out. You should've thought of that before you made that paper airplane. This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of bad behavior. Don't bitch to me, boss man. Thanks to the latest budget cuts, I'm down to using Grade F meat. It would be wonderful if there was a common solution to both our problems. That would be great. Hey, Bart. Watch this. Oh, no! My favorite outfit! Jimbo, this is by far the worst... Mmm. Mmm. Jimbo, why don't you assist Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen? Bite me, Skinner. Well, might we. Jimbo: It's hard for me to clean this giant pot... when you keep spilling meat tenderizer all over me. Oh, great! Now I gotta work in the dark. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. This sandwich tastes so young and impudent. Seymour, what's with the good grub? Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. You remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day? Are you saying you killed Jimbo... processed his carcass, and served him for lunch? Hmm. I wonder where Jimbo is today. He should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago. Frau Lunchlady, please to have another Sloppy Jimbo? That's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. You just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter. For how long? About seven minutes a pound should do it. Okay, I got your German grub right here. Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared... and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called "Uterbraten"? Oh, relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter... and he's in our stomachs right now! Wait, scratch that one. Mom! Mom! You've gotta help! They're cooking kids in the school cafeteria! Listen, kids, you're 8 and 10 years old now. I can't fight all your battles for you. But, Mom! No buts. You march right back to that school... look them straight in the eye and say, "Don't eat me." Okay. Okay. Since so many students have been put on permanent detention... we've merged everyone into a single class. I trust there are no objections? Detention. Psst. [WHISPERING] Hey, you guys, I was just thinking that any one of us could be next. So, what do you say we make a break for it? Easy there, young man. You'll only make yourself tired and stringy. Now to check on the free-range children. Hold on, kids! I'm coming to rescue the lot of you! I'll... Ow! I'm bad at this. I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes, I believe I'll start as you've so often suggested... by eating your shorts. Don't worry, guys. Something always comes along to save us. Nevertheless, I remain confident... that something will come along and save the two Simpson children. Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. You're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of... except that fog that turns people inside out. Huh? Uh-oh. It's seeping in. Stupid, cheap weather stripping! All (singing): One chorus line of people. Dancing till they make us stop. Two! Many dancing people Covered with blood, gore and glop. Just one sniff of that fog And you're inside out. It's worse than that flesh- eating virus You've read about. Vital organs They are what we're dressed in. The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine. Happy Halloween
#06x07 - Bart's Girlfriend^Remember, Bart... I mean, Dances in Underwear. We take the white man alive. All right, Thinks Too Much. It shall be so. Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns. I mean, Native Americans. They're after us because we gave them blankets infected with cooties. I ate all my caps. Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cow dorks! Why do we have to play this corny old game anyway? I brought my jacks! I got twosies! That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the Killmatic 3000 back then. Hey, records from that era are spotty at best. Bart! Lisa! Time for church! Milhouse, time for church! Shlomo, time for your violin lesson! Why the crap do we have to go church anyway? You just answered your own question with that commode mouth. Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency... and how to love your fellow man. And with flaming swords, the Aramites did pierce the eyes of their fellow men... and did feast on what flowed forth. Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves... in the lusts of our flesh... I'm a troll man. I'm a troll man. I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. Awful, awful hair. And now my daughter, Jessica... who has just returned from boarding school... will read the same passage I just read. I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention. Wow, there is a God. I'm telling you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea! Shut up, I know what I'm doing. I hate the sea and everything in it. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you for choosing our church. I've never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over. Hi, I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible. Thanks, Art. I have to go over here now. Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart. It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you. Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes for the last four years? No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different to get along. She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter, and you're the devil's cabana boy. Good. Very good. Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels. Bart Simpson? Yes, ma'am. I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please. But, Bart, we banned you from Sunday school. You were happy. We were happy. Everybody was happy. Particularly the hamster. I've changed my ways. Please give me another chance, ma'am. All right, Bart. The Bible does teach forgiveness. Class, I want you to welcome back our prodigal son. What? What's prodigal mean? Oh, dear. You know, the great thing about Sunday school... is we're finally learning something we can use. Yeah, so true. I have to turn my chair this way now. Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave, no matter what. Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around. A replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath. While you kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet. Must fight Satan. Make it up to him... later. You know, I was considering staying after school... and helping teacher clean up. Do you ever think anything you don't say? There is just no pleasing a girl like that! All that unnecessary behaving. I'm all tense through the chestal area. I need relief. Now, the kilt was only for day-to-day wear. In battle, we donned a full-length ball gown covered in sequins. The idea was to blind your opponent with luxury. 'Tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes. That'll hold me, at least till I get my hands on some kind of explosives. Congratulations, Simpson. You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months' detention. There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest! There's not? You used me, Skinner! You used me! Three months? Hi, Bart. I saw the way they set you up. That was really unfair. Wanna have dinner at my house tonight? Really? Sure. Great. We eat at 7. There's only one thing to do at a moment like this: Strut. I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. Oh, that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he? No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today. So, Bart, how's school going? Jessica always gets straight A's. Well, in my family, grades aren't that important. It's what you learn that counts. Six times five! What is it? Actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career: Olympic gold-medal rocket-sled champ! I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event. Well, no offense, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse. Young man, explain yourself! Sorry. I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night... I heard a rather amusing story. This character named Martin was feeling rather randy... and he was heard to remark... And don't you ever come near my daughter again! Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word "butt"! But... But... But... Make him stop! But... But... But... Make him stop! You're bad, Bart Simpson. No, I'm not. I'm really... Yes, you are. You're bad. And I like it. I'm bad to the bone, honey. Let's go find some fun. But your father said... I told the rev I was going to my room to say my prayers. Smart, beautiful and a liar. So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall. Right there! Put that there! Excellent! You're incredible, Jessica. Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops. It's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body. No way would a minister's daughter go out with you. Oh, yeah? I'll prove it. Hey, Jessica. Yes? Am I supposed to know you? Jessica, we just... That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name. Why? I'm sorry, Bart. You know my parents can't find out about us. And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting. I guess. Hey, you wanna go skateboarding? Actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second. Come on, it'll be fun. Now I have the energy to do anything. Just give me two minutes. Jessica, I think this is too steep. Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude. Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity... I just might be able to hold on. The glue will slow me down. Any glue leaking? No. That glue ain't going nowhere. Nothing's ever gonna stop me. Oh, no. There goes the glue after all. Fun, huh? Have you noticed any change in Bart? New glasses? No. He looks like something might be disturbing him. Probably misses his old glasses. I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him. Yeah. And then we'd get the chair. That's not what I meant. It was, Marge. Admit it. Hi. We should get to class. What's the hurry? We could get in trouble for being late. You worry too much. Come on. If you stay here a while, I'll let you hold my hand. Teamwork! Come on, Bart. If I don't save the wee turtles, who will? Save me from the wee turtles! They were too quick for me! I can't believe it, Bart. I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet. She's like a Milk Dud, Lis: Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside. You gotta give her up. No, no, wait. Hear my plan. Put up with her for seven more years. Then we'll get married. Once the first baby comes, she's bound to settle down and treat me right. After all, I deserve it. Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. Except maybe that boy who works in the library. Do you have Go, Dog, Go? That's in Juvenile. This is Young Adult. Well-read and just a little wild. If only someone could tame him. You're right, Lisa. Love isn't about fixing someone. I'm just gonna give her up cold turkey. I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over. Thanks for the advice, sis. There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her... she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one. Time for church, Bart. I bet your little friend Jessica will be there. Jessica. Bart, be strong. You don't need that little hellcat. Oh, Lis, she's already drawn me to her... with her beautiful siren song. That's very disturbing. Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong? Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug. Oh, good. Here comes the collection plate. "Thirty cents off Shake 'N' Bake." Homer! We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed. You're right about everything, Bart. I have been too reckless. From now on, I am going to settle down. Jessica, what are you doing? Well, it takes money to start a new life. Stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that. Fine. You just lost your cut. I'll just take that. Everyone turn around and look at this. What is it? A Unitarian? Now just relax. For once, you didn't do anything wrong. Just explain yourself and everyone will understand. L... Took the money? Yes, we know. He confessed! Okay. Stop him! He's headed for the window! Son, if you look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money... that's all I need. I didn't take it. Why, you little... How can you lie like that? Homer, stop that! I believe him. Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes? That's what he wore to church. How convenient. Bart, honey, do you know who did take the money? No. See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad. Boo! Boo! Why, you little...! Crook! Thief! Stealer of money from the church! We've gotta talk. Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet. Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward. Don't you see? It's because I care for you that I can't come forward. That doesn't make any sense. Then I just don't feel like it, okay? Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice. With the way you treat me, why should I protect you? Because if you tell, no one will believe you. Remember, I'm the sweet, perfect minister's daughter. And you're just yellow trash. So here's where you're hiding. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople. Thief. Bart, we can't just let her get away with this! Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth-grade level. And her hair smells like red Froot Loops. Yeah? Well, I eat Froot Loops for breakfast. Because of last week's problems... we'll be taking certain precautions with this week's collection. We shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self-esteem. Now for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson... who we'll all be keeping an eye on. I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. But doesn't the Bible teach us "judge not, lest ye be judged," Reverend? I think it may be somewhere towards the back. There is someone among us with a guilty conscience. After much soul-searching, I decided it would be wrong of me to name names. But I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God... to come forward, to confess... and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell! I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam! I was the one that canceled Star Trek! I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick. I am talking to the collection-money thief! Only you can come forward and end this injustice! Oh, what the heck. It was Jessica Lovejoy! If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money. To the little girl's room! Yeah! That's the collection money! Oh, yeah. Smells like church. I guess it's obvious what's happened here. Bart Simpson has somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house. Well, come on! Use your imaginations! No, Dad. I did it. It's your classic cry for attention. Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home... from boarding school a little prematurely. I was expelled, Dad. Remember the pipe bomb? The glee club brawl? Remember the school chapel collection plate? The exploding toilets ring a bell? Come on, Dad, pay attention to me! Hello, in there. Hello? I think you all owe my son an apology. Very sorry. That's okay. Appreciate it. Hi, Jessica. Hi, Bart. Come to watch me suffer? I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience... I really learned a lot. I'm a little wiser and a little less naive. Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want. Well, don't you see, Jessica? Then you really haven't learned... Would you finish scrubbing these steps? Will I? Hey, Jessica! Coming! Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Wait till she sees the second-rate job I do on these stairs.
#06x08 - Lisa on Ice^It's Channel 6 Action News. Ah, Action News. The last place an impressionable kid can go for TV violence. Now here's your Action anchor, Kent Brockman. Hello, I'm Kent Brockman! Our top stories tonight: A tremendous explosion in the price of lumber. "President Reagan dyes... his hair, " says Gary Trudeau in his new musical comedy review. But first let's check the death count from the killer storm... bearing down on us like a shotgun full of snow. As of now, the death count is zero. But it is ready to shoot right up. Oh, my God! Damn you, snow! All right! Snow day! No school tomorrow! That doesn't mean no book report. What if the weatherman is wrong? Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist. Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me... at the Springfield Laugh and Brew and Burgers and Fries on Saturday. The forecast calls for a 75%/% chance of hilarity. I like those odds. Snowball fight! You're gonna eat a blizzard of... unseasonable warmth? I made the snowball from the frost in our freezer. Nice P.J. S, Simpson. Did your mommy buy them for you? Of course she did. Who else would have? All right, Simpson. You win this round. Okay, it's book report time. We'll do them alphabetically. Today it's A through M. I'm saved! I love being a Simpson. Let's see. We have no A's. So let's go right to the B's. Bart. Mrs. Krabappel... I didn't... Attention. This is Principal Skinner... your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students proceed immediately to an assembly... in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. Damn it, I wish we hadn't let the students name that. Children, the times they are becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all-time low. So I've come up with these academic alerts! You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. Your parents won't have to wait until report cards to punish you. How innovative. I like it. Hey, Dolph, take a memo on your Newton: Beat up Martin. Bah! All right, first academic alert: Wiggum, Ralph. I won! I won! No. No, Ralph. This means you're failing English. Me fail English? That's "unpossible." Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography and math. But you're doing quite well in home ec. Hey! Keep it down, man. Simpson... Lisa. Grades are all I have. What could I be failing? I'm smart and a teacher's pet. Gym?! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard! Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder. That's all of them. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How about a present, son? Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates. Done and done. That's not fair. Why is Bart getting a present, and I'm getting chewed out? Ah, the mysteries of life. Tell you what, Simpson. I won't fail you if you join one of those Pee Wee teams outside the school. You mean, where parents push kids into vicious competition... to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory? Look, I don't need this. I inhaled my favorite whistle this morning. Children, that was our only ball. There'll be no team this year. Mom, this is really scary. I'm gonna get my first F ever. Cheer up. So you're not good at sports. It's a very small part of life. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports. I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front too? I tried. Okay, son. Just remember to have fun out there today. And if you lose, I'll kill you! Oh, Dad. All right, Pigs, beat those Gougers. I could've been equipment manager, but no! Our goalie cannot stand up. Tell you what, get some rope. Defense! Defense! Come on! You call that blowing! Oh, yes, we won! We won! We won! Unfortunately, since I bet on the other team... we won't be going for pizza. Well, boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well. Aw, thanks, Dad. How about some adulation from my little sister? Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a concussion. Aw, you're just jealous. Because... you... stink... at... sports! Cut it out, Bart! What the...? You know, I wonder if her skills will transfer over to the game of hockey. Well, only one way to be sure. Heads up, little girl! The goalie of my dreams! Let's try a hard one to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Hey! Way to knock out my teeth! Yeah, that's it, Milhouse. Keep up the chatter. Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't... it's that girls should stick to girl sports. Such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing and such and such. I think women should be able to play any sport men play. But hockey is so violent and dangerous. Look at Milhouse's teeth. Mom, will you stop showing us those? I have to join the team or I'll get an F... that will haunt me for the rest of my life. I now pronounce you president of these United... Stop the inauguration! I just discovered our president-elect... got an F in second-grade gym class! In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime of horror on Monster Island. Don't worry. It's just a name. He said it was just a name! What he meant is that Monster Island is actually a peninsula. Do you have my teeth? No. Okay, hotshots. Now that my daughter is on your team... I want to make a few things clear. Please, Dad. I'll be fine. I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel? Come here, you butterball. Don't make me run! I'm full of chocolate! I can't watch. I don't know how you two can sit here... laughing at poor Lisa while she's probably scared to death. We're laughing with her, Marge. There's a big difference. With her. You really think I did okay out there, Mom? Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net, I really think you helped your team. Okay, little buddy. Hop in. I mean my little girl buddy. That's very nice, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love. Okay, hon. Sucker! Competitive violence, that's why you're here! We're having our best season ever. And I would like to say that it is because of teamwork. Gee, who am I kidding, huh? It's all because of Lisa. Let's hear it for Lisa! Hey, Bart. If Lisa's better than you at hockey... does that mean you're gonna become better than her at school? Maybe I will, Milhouse. Maybe I will. Who can tell me the capital of Spain? Bart Simpson. The square root of 36? Bart Simpson. Who freed the slaves? Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson, stop raising your hand. You haven't had one right answer today. Sorry. This is for wasting teacher's valuable time! Lay off, guys! He's with me. It's a lucky coincidence you happen to be your sister's brother. Don't worry, Bart. They won't bother you anymore. I hardly ever let Mother fight for me anymore. Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna hang out with Lisa... for protection... and to be seen! Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two Cops, but if we hurry, we can catch the last three. Oh, sorry, Bart. Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come, but... you know. Bart, I can spend some time with you. I don't know, Mom. Don't have a stereotypical view of me just because I'm your mother. I know. How about we play the basketball? I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but... Watch out for the Shaq attack! I told you to watch out. Hey, Milhouse! Knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo, Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shinguard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone! Wow! Eye of the tiger! Mouth of a teamster! To think of all the time I wasted on you! Well, not wasted... I love you. Let me give my special little winner a big, big hug. Ma. I think I'm all hugged out. Ah, one more. Hello, Queen Lisa. Bart! What are you doing in my room? Lisa, certain differences, rivalries if you will, have come up between us. At first, I thought we could talk it over like civilized people. But instead, I just ripped the head off Mr. Honey Bunny! Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy. Mr. Honey Bunny! Quiet down, Bart! Bart, just get out of here. It's a free country. You get out. That doesn't make sense. I know you are, but what am I? Get out! Get out! Okay! But on my way, I'm gonna be doing this: If you get hit, it's your own fault. Okay. Then I'm gonna start kicking air like this: And if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault. I better go check that out. Now, Homer, don't you eat this pie. Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this: And if you get eaten, it's your own fault. Oh, my... Oh, the hell with it. Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it! Mom, that is really annoying. Bart started it. Lisa started it. I don't care who started it! I don't want to see you... fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat, you are not in competition with each other. Hey! Apu just called. This Friday, Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition! Don't go easy on each other because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love! Fight! Fight! Fight! Okay, I'm gonna make a little deal with you mugs. I'm gonna let you out to see my team play the game... if you promise to return to your cells. Sorry, pig. We can't make that promise. All right. All right, I'll sweeten the deal. You can see the game, you don't have to come back... but you have to promise not to commit any more crimes, okay? No. I'll take that as a yes. All right, we're free! At 7 tonight the games begin Bart versus Lisa, who will win? Their father's fat and their mother's thin And Grampa Simpson reeks of gin. Hey! That's Obsession for Men. Pass ketchup. You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump. I asked for ketchup! I'm eating salad here. I won't have any aggressive condiment-passing in this house. Hello. Moe, what are you doing here? What? What? A bartender can't come by and say hi to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge. Oh, gee, I like what you done to your hair. You caught me at a real bad time, Moe. I hope you understand I'm too tense to pretend I like you. Yeah, and how are the little kids doing? I mean, really, how are they doing? Any disabling injuries? Something that the gambling community... might not yet know about? Here, let me see those knees. Moe, I think you should leave. But Blanche, you gotta help me out here! Please! I'm 64 grand in the hole! They're gonna take my thumbs! Charge! Good luck tonight, sis. I'll try not to hurt you! Don't worry. I'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head. Mr. Honey Bunny! You inhumane monster! You want a piece of me? Hey, hey. Stop it, stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game. Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best. No! Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you? No. You can't possible like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothing for nobody. Homer, we can't root for one child over the other. You wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us. Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom! Hi, Mom, over here! Mom! Hi, kids. And now to honor America, here's Krusty the Clown. Shouldn't have turned down those cue cards. I love Bart! No, wait! I love Lisa! Beer? Oh, Marge, I love you. He tripped my boy! I demand vengeance! I want vengeance! Jimbo Jones called for tripping. A penalty shot will be taken by Bart Simpson. Oh, my God. A penalty shot with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise! The loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore! Kill her, boy! Kill her! Stop him dead, little girl! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Great game, Lis. Great game, Bart. Tie game?! What the hell?! This is outrageous. Oh, I've never been so proud of them. They're both losers. Losers! Rip off! We paid for blood! Let's tear this place apart! Good idea! Those kids are, like, so sweet. If only they had had Pee Wee hockey when I was a lad. Oh, well.
#06x09 - Homer Badman^Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow? Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash. You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly doughnuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out, you would. I'm talking about the Candy lndustry Trade Show. How did you get tickets? They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump Bar... and Krusty Klump Bar with almonds. Hey. Hey. I have asked you nicely not to mangle my merchandise. You leave me no choice but to ask you nicely again. Can I come to the candy show? Can I? No, me. Take me, me, me. Sorry, kids. But this the one event I want my darling wife by my side. 0h, well, thank you, Homer. But take one of the kids. Marge, they can't carry enough candy. They have puny little muscles. Not big, ropy ones like you. You go, Mom. For the greater good. For the greater good. Homer, are all these pockets necessary? They wouldn't be if you would sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair. Well, that's the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university or a scary-looking hobo. Please, the hobo. Please, the hobo. The hobo. Hi. I'm Ashley Grant. Ashley Grant. You gave a talk on women's issues at my school... on how we don't have to be second-class citizens. Mom, how can you leave us with this maniac? Hurry. If we're early, we can get a picture... with the two surviving Musketeers. There's also a baby somewhere upstairs. So you're one of those "don't-call-me-a-chick" chicks, huh? Sorry about my unenlightened brother. He will make the next few hours a living hell. Oh, I don't know. See this, Bart? Disemboweler IV. The game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks. Do a little housework and you can play for five minutes. No way. Yes. See, Lisa? Male's aren't hard to tame. They all follow their video cartridges. Mr. Goodbar to the front desk. The front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar. I feel like a kid in some kind of a store. Brilliant. Exquisite. You'll do well. Give me those. Well, as you can see, I have created a lemon ball so sour... it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. The candy, known as 77X42... Where the hell is the candy? I don't know. Hey, sir. Try our wax lips. It's the candy of 1000 uses. Like what? One, a humorous substitute for your own lips. Keep going. Two... I'm needed in the basement. You're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am. Gummi bears. Gummi calves' heads. Gummi jawbreakers. What's that? That is the rarest gummi of them all. The gummi Venus de Milo, carved by gummi artisans... who work exclusively in the medium of gummi. Will you two stop saying "gummi" so much? Must have rare gummi. Distract the salesman. No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further. How did they get there? Now, this is going to take all my skill. Halt! Halt! Run, Marge. Save the booty. After him. He has the gummi. See you in hell, candy boy! Lis, I found a big caramel deposit on her back. I'm coming. Wait a minute. Wait. Where's my gummi de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far. She has no arms. I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the babysitter home now. She's been in the car for 20 minutes. Relax, Marge. There's plenty for her to do in there. See? She's having the time of her life. So a graduate student, huh? How come you can go to the moon, but can't make my shoes smell good? I'm sorry? Nobody's blaming you. Could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch in two places at once. Just drop me off here. Precious Venus. Thank you. Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast. Why don't we give it to some needy children then? The candy conventioneers tracked us down. There he is. There's the man that sexually harassed me. For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a... Two, four, six, eight Homer's crime was very great "Great" meaning "large or immense" We use it in the pejorative sense. Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a schoolgirl. At any rate, I believe you. I think you should go outside and straighten this out. Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable. You grabbed me in the car. Oh, that? No. I was grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants. Yeah, right. That's the oldest excuse in the book. Come on. I'm a decent guy. Why would anybody wanna touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from. I don't understand. What is she saying you did? Lisa, remember that postcard Grampa sent us from Florida... of that alligator biting that woman's bottom? Oh, yeah. That was brilliant. That's right. We all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman. And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal? Well, that's kind of a gray area. We know you're innocent, Dad. Thanks, kids. They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown. Do your worst, protestors. You can't stop me from living my life. No respect for women. No peace. Try to push the right buttons now. We ain't crazy about nuclear power either! You people aren't allowed in here. It's okay. They're with me. They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay. Go. Homer... I talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. I said you were a decent man. She wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there's nothing I can do. You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh, no. On own. On own. I need help. Oh, God, help me. Help me, God! Hello? Hello, Homer, this is God... frey Jones from the TV magazine show Rock Bottom. We're aware of your problems, and, Mr. Simpson, we want to help. I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and even-handed. I'll do it. Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on the gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy... I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is... That was great, Mr. Simpson. We got everything we need. Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice. Tonight on Rock Bottom: We go undercover at a s*x farm for s*x hookers. I keep telling you, I just grow sorghum here. And where are the hookers? Around back. But first, she was a university honors student who devoted her life to kids. Until the night a grossly overweight pervert named Homer Simpson... gave her a crash course in depravity. "Babysitter and the Beast." Oh, crap. Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on her sweet can... I grabbed her sweet can... Oh, just thinking about her can... I just wish I had her sweet, sweet, sweet can. So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her can. What do you have to say in your defense? Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further. No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me. Get back. Get back! Mr. Simpson, no! Dramatization: May not have happened. Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea. Under the sea. Under the sea. There'll be no accusations. Just friendly crustaceans Under the sea. That's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It won't happen. Not with that attitude. Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over. It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothing ever blows over for me. Simpson scandal update. Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent he believes gives him sexual powers. Hey, that's a half-truth. I don't know Homer Simpson. I never met Homer Simpson or had any contact with him, but... I'm sorry, I can't go on. That's okay. Your tears say more than real evidence ever could. Today on Ben: Mothers and runaway daughters reunited by their hatred of Homer Simpson. And here's your host, Gentle Ben. I just have one thing to say. Let's have less Homer Simpsons and more money for public schools. Ben, I have a question. No, Ben. No. And now we return to Fox Night at the Movies. Homer S: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber. Starring Dennis Franz. Portrait. Sounds classy. Doesn't it? No, Mr. Simpson. A cat is a living creature. I don't care. Now I'm gonna grab me something sweet. No, Mr. Simpson. That's sexual harassment. If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud, the whole country will hear. With a man in the White House? Not likely. This is hour 57 of our live, round-the-clock coverage... outside the Simpson estate. Remember to tune in tonight at 8:00 for highlights of today's vigil... including when the garbage man came... and when Marge Simpson put the cat out. Possibly because it was harassed. We don't know. There's no way to see into the Simpson home... without some kind of infrared, heat-sensitive camera. So let's turn it on. Now, this technology is new to me... but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven... rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over 400 degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll. Ninety-five percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll... which is not legally binding, unless Proposition 304 passes. And we all pray it will. I don't have a friend in the world. Let us through. We're Homer's true friends. Oh, really? Come on, let us through, you vultures. Oh, Marge. It's a miracle. How can you judge this man... without talking to the people who know him best? We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the bidding starts at 10 G's. I bid 10 G's. Ten-five G's. I need a hug. How come you guys hesitated? Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do. It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you. Maybe TV is right. TV's always right. Are you hugging the TV? No. No. And the number one reference that I am running into the ground is: Homer Simpson. Is Homer Simpson. I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know. Evening at the lmprov. They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s. I think about weird stuff. Like, what would happen if E. T. And Mr. T had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E. T., wouldn't you? And, you know, I think he'd sound a little something like this: "I pity the fool who doesn't phone home." I wouldn't wanna be Mr. T right now. Homer. Homer, the kids have a great idea how you can clear your name. The media's making you a monster because they don't care about truth. All they care about is entertainment. You need a forum where they don't know the meaning of entertainment: Public access television. But those shows all look so crummy. Well, we could dress it up a bit. We can bring a fern, and a folding chair from the garage... and the most decorative thing of all, the truth. There are only 49 stars on that flag. I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I recognize Missouri. Now it's time for The lnnocence Report... with Homer Simpson. Hello. I am Homer Simpson. Or, as some of you wags have dubbed me, "Father Goose." You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life. But harassing women is not one of them. Like one time, we were having this race with this stupid, old-timey bicycle... with the big wheel in front. So I figure, "We'll see about that." So I get this big chunk of cinderblock, and l... Oh, gotta go. Innocent. Dad, you did it. I am so proud of you. The switchboards are lighting up. Two calls. That's our best ever. Hello? No, Janice doesn't live here. Hello? Yes, I am interested in long-distance savings. Very interested. Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Needs more ice cream. So you don't like the old-time bikes, huh? Homer, I love amateur video. And your show is the most amateur video I ever saw. My hobby is secretly videotaping couples in cars. I didn't come forward because in this country... it makes you look like a pervert. But every single Scottish person does it! Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby. Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby. Here we go. Precious Venus. Thank you. Dad, this clears you completely. You know, the courts might not work anymore... but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else... justice will be done. See? Homer, I thought you were an animal. But your daughter said you were a decent man. I guess she was right. You're both right. In our mad pursuit of a scoop... we members of the press sometimes make mistakes. Rock Bottom would like to make the following corrections: Wow, V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline. And Ted Koppel is a robot. There's you, Dad. Tomorrow on Rock Bottom. He's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper". Oh, that man is sick. Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer. But listen to the music. He's evil. Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear? Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing. Let's never fight again.
#06x10 - Grandpa vs. Sexual Inadequacy^We now return to the 1971 film... Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco FreakOut... starring Troy McClure. Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds... then what happened to the bag with our stash? There's more than one way to get high, baby. Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber... on late night TV? Is there something wrong, Homie? It's just that I've only seen this twice before... and I've seen you every night for the last 11 ye... What I meant to say is, we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise. Enchiladas. Mom! Dad! Don't turn on the light! There's a UFO outside my window. Seriously. Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree. Can I sleep in there with you guys tonight? No. Can I sit on the roof... with a baseball bat in case a UFO comes? Yes, that's fine. Good, good. I hope you kept the Homie fires burning. Homer! Homer, wake up. Wake up. What? We need to talk about the marital difficulties we've been having lately. Marge, there's just too much pressure. What with my job, the kids, traffic snarls... political strife at home and abroad. But I promise you the second all those things go away, we'll have s*x. I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help. How about a book? Okay. A tasteful book. Oh, all right. Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu! I don't want people to see us looking at these books. What you looking at? I'm just reading up on artillery. Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in... This one's a good choice and it's not smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey. That Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa. Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American. Mom, Dad, look! This biography of Peter Uebberoth is only 99 cents. And I found the new Al Gore book. Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow. I hope it's as exciting as his other book: Rational Thinking, Reasonable Future. I'm getting this book on UFOs. Did you know they're real? But there's a conspiracy to cover it up. Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy. Mr. Vice President, someone finally bought a copy of your book. Well, this calls for a celebration. Celebrate good times Come on! I will. Hello, Americans. Paul Harvey here. Did you know every good American is at heart an erotic American? It's true. A famous couple... I don 't need to tell you it was Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower. Offered this advice: "Double your pleasure with a bath... together." Homie, I can't quite fit. The faucet's jammed into my back. I'm stuck. So am I. Kids? Kids? Kids? Kids? A romantic vacation can provide titillation. Sensual, sanitary seclusion awaits you at any of America 's fine... AAA-approved motor lodges. The Arabian Nights Room looks nice. The Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus. Sorry there, Fred and Ethel. Should have made a reservation. We only got one room left. The toilet is overflowing in the Caveman Room. Oh, here we are. The Utility Room. This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room. No, honey. It's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room. Don't mind me, folks. Just need to get the old wet-dry vac. By now, your new improved love life should have you flinging woo... like nobody's business. So to you, Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid... good day. Welcome home, son. I broke two lamps and lost all your mail. What's wrong with your wife? You wouldn't understand. Flu? No. Protein deficiency? No. Pneumonoultramicroscopic- silicovolcanoconiosis? No. Unsatisfying s*x life? N... Yes! But please, don't you say that word. What? s*x? What's so unappealing about hearing your elderly father... talk about s*x? I had s*x. You're home safe. See you the next time we need your signature. Oh, you never wanna spend any time with me. But I can help you with your loving problem. I got a home remedy that'll put the dowsers back in your trousers. Legend has it my great grandpappy stumbled upon this recipe... when he was trying to invent a cheap substitute for holy water. Here you g... Hey! Here you go, you ingrate! Think of me when you're having the best s*x of your life. Drink it! Here's $50. Go to the movies, then take a cab to your aunt's. Stay there. Call you later. Now, now, now. Homie, what's...? Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards. What do you think Mom and Dad are doing? I don't know. Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one. That tonic really works. You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together. You want me to spend more time with Dad? What about my New Year's resolution? You can make a lot of money. Yeah. Where are my pants? You threw them out the window. You said you'd never need them again. Oh, hurry, Neddie. They're awful. You just be ready with that garbage bag. Oh, mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointment with get-rich-quick schemes... I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme. And quick. Sir? Hello, sir. Yes. You look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife. So... I guess people have some sort of moral objection to our s*x drug. Let me sell it, you idiot. Step right up and witness the magnificent medicinal miracle... of Simpson & Son's patented Revitalizing Tonic! Put some ardor in your larder with our energizing, moisturizing... tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising, "her-prising," revitalizing tonic! I doubt very highly that one elixir can boast so many fantastic properties. What say we amscray out of here and have a wild wingding... at the cyclotron, doctor. Anything you say, professor. Tonight, we'll push the twin beds together. And I found something for Milhouse down at the mall too. A pup tent. Oh, boy! Now I can sleep out in the yard! Yeah! Every single night. I've discovered that the rejuvenating effect... is actually a mild form of poisoning. No doubt a result of the unsanitary conditions... in Grampa Simpson's bathtub. Nonetheless... What's going on? Where are all the grownups? Who cares? With no adults around, I run this city. Carry on. Listen to this. "Unexplainable behavior. Individuals acting in a secretive fashion... are often involved with UFOs or other paranormal phenomena... e.g. Telephone explosions." Jeez! If it's in a book, it's gotta be true. Scary, no? And this guy is head of the Spaceology Department... at the Correspondence College of Tampa. Will you cook my dinner for me? My parents aren't around and I'm not allowed to turn on the stove. Hurry up. We got a lot of tonic to sell and a lot of towns to visit. Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid. Great. I'm gonna be stuck in a car all weekend with that wheezy windbag. And that's what's wrong with Bart's generation. Now as for your generation... And for the minimal outlay of one dollar... you can take home a bottle of liquid Lothario... distilled Don Juan, catalytically carbonated Casanova. Lock old Rover in the shed, because man has a new best friend... in Simpson & Son's Revitalizing Tonic. I'm not convinced. I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs. All questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed... with one incontrovertible demonstration. May I have a volunteer from the audience? Yes, you, sir. You've never seen me before, is that correct? That is correct. Well, then how come his face is on the bottle? You're the worst shill ever! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business. They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music. Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people. You fool. Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy? Or have they gotten to you too? Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Haven't you ever heard of Ockham's razor? The simplest explanation is probably the correct one. So, what's the simplest explanation? I don't know. Maybe they're all reverse vampires and they have to get home before dark. Reverse vampires! Vampires! The undead! Hey, wait a minute. That's Amos Pierson's moose farm. Make a right here. Why are we stopping at this dump? That's the house you grew up in, son. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted. Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in '63. Farm went bust after the cows started giving sour milk. Something must've spooked them good. Stupid cows! Oh, memories. If this old place could talk, it'd say... There she is. The old Radiation King. You'd park yourself right there and watch for hours on end. If I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question... with yet another flip remark. Look at me, Mom. I am President Kennedy. Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president someday. You, president? This is the greatest country in the world. We've got a system set up to keep people like you... from ever becoming president. Quit your daydreaming, melonhead. Quit your daydreaming, melonhead. Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am. Like a travel agent... to a great scientist. Or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm. Who are you to complain? You lock me up in a home... and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas. Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me. That's because you're a screwup. You're the screwup! Why, you little... All right. All right, that's it. We're going home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic. If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago... you'd have never been born and I'd have been happy. You were an accident! Get out. I'm sorry I said that. Out. I'm gonna get out of the car. And I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa... Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training. Dang. I'm sorry. Hi? Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life? Of course not, Marge. Just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't wanna have me. You didn't wanna have Bart. You're never supposed to tell the child. You tell Bart all the time. But when I do it, it's cute. So finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. Milhouse. Okay, here's what we've got. The Rand Corporation... in conjunction with the saucer people... Thank you. ...under the supervision of the reverse vampires... are forcing our parents to go to bed early... in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of dinner. We're through the looking glass here, people. Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty, chewy, chocolatey... Put it away, boy! ...situation. And your daddy has realized something very important. A father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting now, I promise to spend more time with you... and give you the attention you deserve. I can't breathe. And feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial... from my own flesh and blood. The son who puts the fun in Simpson & Son... my son, Barney. I used to be a fat, disgusting slob. That medicine seems to be giving your son a lot of gas. I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem. It just ain't the same without Homer. He knew how to drive a car. Son. My dear son. From now on, I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters, your old man is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike. Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: That is a girl's bike. You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president! Dad! I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing. No, Dad. I wanna get down. This tire is filthy and the steel belts are poking me. No! No! No offense, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun... than your half-assed over-parenting. But I'm using my whole ass. Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary. Someday you'll thank me for all this scary love. But now I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking. I'm sure he meant to say "drinking." That's what I assumed. Here's where it all started to go wrong. How am I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself? Oh, Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning... when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father. Wait a minute... Dad! This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain. This tonic's caused me nothing but trouble. You've done all the damage you're gonna do. Oh, nuts! Dad! Son! I'm a screwup. I burned down our house. No. I'm a screwup. I burned down our house. You know what? What? We're both screwups. It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me... I never said anything nice about you. So are you gonna say something nice now? I hadn't thought that far ahead. Okay, here it goes. I'm not sorry I had you, son. And I was always proud... that you weren't a short man. Oh, Dad. What do you say we roll on the grass, son? I'm with you, Dad.
#06x11 - Fear of Flying^Hey, Moe, you got change for a 5? Yeah, sure thing, Lenny. A snake in the cash register! Yeah, great prank, fellas. Great. Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight. Hey, Moe, you wanna smell my flower? Do I! I'm burning up here! Taking advantage of my alcohol-soaked clothes. Oh, it's funny and it makes you think. I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar. This is gonna be great. Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now. That's not funny, Homer. Yeah. We were just messing around, and you had to go too far. How many people want Homer banned from this place for life? Yeah! Come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me. Sorry, Homer. You should've thought of that before giving me the sugar-me-do. I'm taking your caricature down from Mount Lushmore... and I'm pulling your favorite song out of the jukebox. "It's Raining Men"? Yeah, not no more it ain't. Joke's on them. I'm still alive. Cheer up, Homer. Can't. Okay. What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. I am not going to dignify that with an answer. Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know the Chinese use the same word for crisis... as they do for opportunity? Yes. "Cris-a-tunity." You're right. I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've ever been in my entire life. Bart, where's my wallet? Right here, Dad. Thank you. Wow, classy. Good evening, sir. Would you please leave without a fuss right now? Okay. This looks like a nice, friendly place. Sammy, you're too old to go on a date with two twins... on the same night you're supposed to marry Diane without Rebecca knowing. I'll make you a bet. If this affects my major-league comeback, I'll sell the bar. Woody, give me a beer. I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson. My chiropractor says I can't carry you home anymore. Just give me another beer, you brain-dead hick. I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you! Settle down, Normie. Gotta save those pipes for karaoke. I love you guys. Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know. This lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit! Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies. What was her problem? Greetings, good man. Might I trouble you for a drink? Oh, get out of here, Homer. Homer? Who is Homer? My name is Guy lncognito. Oh, my God. This man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail! Here, Puff. Here, Puff. The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking. Shut up, liver! My liver hurts. I'd like a beer, please. Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink here. But I am a pilot. Where's your uniform? I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment. Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loaner. We need a pilot, pronto. Who wants to fly to the Windy City? I'll go! Me! I'm your man! Conditions are a bit windy. Well, on second thought, maybe I'll sit down. You. But l... You're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you? Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here. You flyboys. You crack me up. But I keep telling you, I'm not a pilot. And I keep telling you you flyboys crack me up! Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your copilot. Yeah... As a change of pace... I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan. And I'll just get us started. We'll need that to live. If word gets out about this, Crazy Clown Airlines will be a laughingstock. In exchange for your silence... I'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United States. Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the freak states. Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives... we can fly anywhere we want. Alaska! Hawaii! I don't know, Homer. We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season. But, Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state. But getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden. Come on, Marge. I wanna shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I wanna explore the world. I wanna watch TV in a different time zone. I wanna visit strange, exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a footlong hero. I wanna live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you, please? So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh? Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire. Oh, great. I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby. We must be really flying high. Those people down there look all tiny and blurry. Just like the inside of a cataract. Attention, passengers. Due to our policy of overselling flights, this flight has been oversold. In accordance with FAA rules... the first two people to the front will be upgraded to first class. Okay, you two. Come on, Bart, they're gonna pamper us. Not literally, of course. I come for the service... but I stay for the legroom. Flight crew, prepare for takeoff. I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off. Marge, what's wrong? Are you hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it? Homer, I never told you this before... but I'm not a good flier. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors. Take it easy, Marge. How about if we dope you up real good? Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! It's okay, Marge, we don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us. You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something. I'm sure it's nothing. Mom, are you feeling any better? Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it. Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying. So much for the days when I could say, "At least my mother's normal." Everybody's got a fear of something. Not everybody. Sock puppets. Where?! Where?! Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it? Sure as sugar. Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened... push it deep down inside her so she'll never annoy us again. If we don't encourage her to vent her feelings... they can come out in other ways. I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. They've been living in sin. Mom, you've been cooking all night? Judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one, you are. See, Dad? I told you Mom would have problems. No, no, honey, it's all right. Really, I'm fine. I'm all right. Mother always said don't complain. Be good. Behave. Behave. Be nice. Smile. Be polite. Don't make waves. You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave. Marge, it's 3 a.m. Shouldn't you be baking? In a little while. Mom, can we talk to you? Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness. Neat. Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy. No, I don't need therapy. I'm fine. And it's too expensive. And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families. It turns wives against husbands, children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour... to get top-notch therapy. Hello. Radio Psychic. You will die a terrible, terrible death. I'm sorry. That was our last caller. Okay, I'm getting something now. Okay. You will die a terrible, terrible death. But... Thank you for calling Radio Psychic. Do you have a song request? "It's Raining Men." Now, Marge, "Dear Abby" says... seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Here are some upbeat titles. Hero. Fearless. Alive! No thanks to the plane, many of us are still... alive! Alive! We certainly are. Pass me another hunk of copilot. Dad, Mom's getting worse. You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is. She's fine. All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family. You'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans. Dad, I like picking beans with Grandma. Well, keep it up, then. Okay, I will. Good. You do that. Fine. You'll be picking many a bean. Hope I do. I don't believe it! Principal Skinner. Well, well, well. I never thought I'd win this easy. This has nothing to do with you. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother... Mother. Leave that man alone with his pain and sit down. Okay. All right, how much do you charge? If money is a problem, I charge on a sliding scale. I can go as low as $30 an hour. Keep sliding. Thirty dollars will be fine. First, what are your qualifications? Well... Oh, no. I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials. I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him. I'm not here to blame anyone. Marge, therapy can be an intense process. We'll go deep into your subconscious... and we're not going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of flying. Don't worry. This is a private sanctuary... where whatever transpires will be just between us. Oh, that's just Murray the window washer. He comes every day at 12:00. But it's a few seconds before 12:00. Ever since you started therapy, all you can do is talk about yourself. Well, what about me, Marge? I just left my first session. I haven't even opened my mouth yet. You see? You see? "I just left my first session... and I haven't opened my mouth yet." Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying... but it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma. Think back. What's the earliest memory you have of something bad happening? That would have to be my first day of school. They got this thing called a fire drill. They use it to drill a flaming hole in your head. And there's only one big toilet, and they make you all go at the same time. The kids at school were even worse. You like the Monkees? You know they don't write their own songs. They do so. They don't play their own instruments. No! No! That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat. Kids can be so cruel. But it's true. They didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments. The Monkees weren't about music, Marge. They were about rebellion, about political and social upheaval. Did you talk about me in therapy today? I don't think so. Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family. Happy family. I keep having the same dream. I'm the mother from Lost in Space. Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith? Oh, being stuck on this godforsaken planet... has vanquished what little appetite I had. Warning! Warning! Dr. Smith refuses to do his astro-chores. Why, you clattering clank of cogs and... My dear lady, as you well know, my back is a disaster area. D'oh, the pain! D'oh, the pain of it all! Danger! Danger! My hooks are flailing wildly. Wait! Daddy, wait! Please don't leave! Take me with you! Marge, are you aware you just said "Please don't leave" to your daddy? No, I didn't. Yes, you did. And you also infringed on any number of copyrights. Now, let's talk about your father. Sure, okay. I'll talk about Father. Father Christmas. That's what they call Santa Claus in England. They drive on the wrong side of the road there. Now, that's crazy. People always say how small England is, but you couldn't fit it all in here. Not by a long shot. You know what, I'm cured. Marge, get back here and tell me about your father. What did he do for a living? Okay. Okay, but you're gonna make a big deal out of this. He was a pilot. A pilot? This is a big deal. You see? Marge, this may not be the best time to bring this up... but your last check bounced. Wait, I'm remembering something. Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of... I was a little girl... Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now. Why does Daddy have to leave? Because he's a pilot. He flies all over the world. I wanna see Daddy fly. Margie! No, come back! Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Dad...? So who wants preflight cookie? Fig Newtons? Hydrox? Daddy? Don't look at me! Don't look at me! My father was a stewardess. Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here. Today male flight attendants, or stewards, are common. They are? Yes. Thanks to trailblazers like your father. You might say he was a pioneer. Yeah. You might even say he was an American hero. Let's not go nuts. The important thing is that we've pinpointed... the precise moment when you developed your fear of flying. Wait, some other stuff is coming back to me. Open wide. Here comes the airplane. This is what a corn field looks like, honey. You think those things could also have contributed to my fear of flying? Yes, yes. It's all a rich tapestry. Oh, thank you. You've changed my life. We've really just begun to scratch the surface. There's still the serious problem of your husband. That's okay. You don't have to make her into a superwoman. She can get on the plane, that's plenty. Thank you, doctor. Whenever the wind whistles through the leaves... I'll think, "Lowenstein. Lowenstein." My name is Zweig. Lowenstein... Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this. Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax. That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling. That's just the carp swimming around your ankles.
#06x12 - Homer the Great^Looks like you got a leak. Could you start fixing it? The basement is getting awfully flooded. And I think the cat's down there. Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two, three weeks. And that's if I order them today. Which I won't. Oh, dear. Emergency call. Gotta go. What should we do until you get back? Put a pan down there. It didn't work. Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report will get me out of this one. This is Ernie Pie. We got a little accident that's backing traffic up as far as this reporter can see. Hi, Dad. Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places? It's a secret. Shut up. All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list. Hey, will you guys help me fix my...? Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me? It's a secret. Shut up. Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight? No, we're busy. Yeah, we got things to do. Like what? It's a secret. Shut up. So Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. They don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy. A conspiracy, eh? You think they're involved in the Kennedy assassination? I do now. I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go. Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. You stalked Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden. Well, something did. I don't want you stalking anyone. Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside... to stalk... Lenny and Carl... All I have to do is follow the yellow-drip road. There's our secret meeting place. Yes. Let's go inside. Sounds good. I can see everything and they're none the wiser. An intruder! He will pay the ultimate price. Yes, the ultimate price. Get out of here! I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird, strange, sick, twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff. And I want in. We don't know what you're talking about, Homer. You can't join the Stonecutters. It's too exclusive. Oh, well. That was a real nice secret organization we had once. Stonecutters, eh? How do I join? There are two ways to gain membership: Be the son of a Stonecutter. Next. Or save the life of a Stonecutter. Hey! I saved your life. That egg sandwich could've killed you by cholesterol. Forget it, Homer. While it has been established eggs contain cholesterol... it has not been proven that they raise the level... of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream. Those Egg Council creeps got to you too? Oh, you got it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that. You'd better run, egg! Why don't people like me, Marge? Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person. Why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks? I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer. It is. It's been happening to me all my life. Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in. There's plenty of room. Sorry. Not you, Homer. Why not? But you let in Homer Glumpet. It says "no Homers." We're allowed to have one. I felt so left out. Kids can be so cruel. We can? Thanks, Mom. Cut it out, Bart! I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters. What do they do there, Dad? I'm a member. What do they do? What don't they do? Oh, they do so many things, they never stop. Oh, the things they do there. My stars. You don't know what they do, do you? Not as such, no. I'm a Stonecutter. Remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa? Do I ever. It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge. I know, I know. Maybe we should be listening to him now. I'm a member! What? What? You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa? Oh, sure. Let's see. I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist. I'm the president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance, for some reason. Here it is. The Stonecutters. This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member. I'll take this Communist one too. Coming through. Can't throw me out. My father's a member. I'm in, I'm in. Okay, okay, Homer, you're in. Just don't point that thing at me. Thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated? As soon as Number One gets here. Number One? What kind of stupid wiener name is that? "Hello, my name is Number One." And so forth. We call each other by number. Carl is Number 14, I'm Number 12. Burnsie is Number 29. You outrank Mr. Burns here? Sure. Watch. Hey, 29, get over here! Thank you, sir. May I have another? Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder. Is he the leader? Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold... that someday a Chosen One will... Okay, okay. I didn't ask for your life story. Let the initiation begin. All Stonecutters must take the Leap of Faith. If you survive this five-story plunge, your character will be proven. Happy landings! I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off. This ritual is called Crossing the Desert. And this we call the Unblinking Eye. Hey, have you ever noticed that the Crossing the Desert... is a lot like the Unblinking Eye? And exactly like the Wreck of the Hesperus. And now the final ordeal: The Paddling of the Swollen Ass, with paddles. And by the sacred parchment, I swear that if I reveal the secrets... of the Stonecutters, may my stomach become bloated... and my head be plucked of all but three hairs. He should have to take a different oath. Everyone takes the same oath. Welcome to the club, Number 908. You have joined the Sacred Order of the Stonecutters... who since ancient times have split the rocks of ignorance... that obscure the light of knowledge and truth. Now let's all get drunk and play Ping-Pong. He's already kind of heavy, you know, and... Well, to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part for you. So it's still gonna be a couple of weeks. Oh, really? Yes. Really? Yes. Yes. But what if I were to shake your hand in this way? Well, I didn't realize you were a member. So long, suckers. Same old space, huh, Dad? Yep. But they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door. Sweet. Jealous? Well, no. We've got the same chair. You're jealous. Your membership pack. What's this? You put that on your car so you won't get any tickets. This keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet. Oh, and don't bother calling 911 anymore. Here's the real number. I still don't believe all the Founding Fathers were Stonecutters. That's because you trust your stupid schoolbooks. Here's what really happened at the signing... of the Declaration of lndependence. And a nation is born. Now let us party like 'twere 1799! Quaff! Quaff! Quaff! Please, sir. You're destroying my establishment. We just created the greatest democracy on earth, lowlife commoner! Get out! Wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18. Homer, a man who called himself "you know who"... just invited you to a secret "wink-wink" at the "you know what." Sure are popular now that you're a Stonecutter. Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoist... AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people look deep within my soul... and assign me a number based on the order in which I joined. Who controls the British crown? Who keeps the metric system down? We do We do. Who leaves Atlantis off the maps? Who keeps the Martians under wraps? We do We do. Who holds back the electric car? Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star? We do We do. Who robs cavefish of their sight? Who rigs every Oscar night? We do. We do. Thank you. Tonight we are here... to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th anniversary. And in honor of this momentous occasion... we're having ribs. Yeah! I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my brethren. So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal... in the shadow of the hallowed sacred parchment. Homer. Oh, yeah. Thanks, Lenny. This is just appalling and outrageous. What? Did I miss something? Oh, God! No, Homer, no! This is outrageous! You can't do that! No! You really are stupid. And the official Stonecutter underwear too. Please don't kick me out. This society's everything to me. Please give me another chance. I've learned my lesson! I've learned my lesson! That's it! How can we punish him further? Oh, sorry. Homer Simpson, for your continuing and baffling desecration... of our beloved sacred parchment... you are hereby banished from the Stonecutters forever. And as a final humiliation, you must walk home naked... dragging behind you the Stone of Shame. The mark! Oh, that. It's just a birthmark. And I'll thank you not to stare. He's the Chosen One. You are the Chosen One... whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. Now to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation. Remove the Stone of Shame. Attach the Stone of Triumph! Mental note: Don't overdo this. Peekaboo! I always wondered if there was a God. And now I know. There is, and it's me. You're not a god, Homer. Remember, Dad, all glory is fleeting. So? Beware the ldes of March. No. I know you're happy now... but it won't last forever. Everything lasts forever. Getting what you want all the time will leave you unfulfilled and joyless. Remove the girl. You're not with your Stonecutters. There are no lackeys around to carry out your... Another strike for the Chosen One! Hurrah! That's just an excellent break. Oh, most assuredly. Absolutely. I'm out. No, no, no. Homer... you have a royal sampler. Oh, I win again, don't I? Good one. Nice hand, Chosen One. You know, I think you guys are letting me win. No! No! No! From now on I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right? Yeah. Well... Run. The grand exalted leader requests a moment of your time. Class dismissed. Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading. You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you... from other human beings. What do you mean, isolated? Well, maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people. I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up and make them reenact the Civil War. Dad, that doesn't help people. Couldn't hurt. Unless the monkeys started hurting people. Which they almost certainly would. Brothers. Brothers! Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer... let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate. He's gone mad with power, like that Albert Schweitzer guy. Oh, for the love of God! Somebody get the Jaws of Life! Higher! Higher! Oh, I'll give you higher, my filthy little urchin. You've won this round. Oh, thank you, Mr. Simpson. It looks so much better. A beautiful sky blue. You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers the Stonecutters behind me... this is the beginning of a better world for all of us. We gotta kill him! Take it easy, Moe. Let's hear from the Stonecutter World Council before we act too rashly. Kill him. Kill him. Kill the fool! Afraid I have to disagree... with Orville, Jack and Mister. Can't we just do something to his voice box? We might as well face the truth. As long as we're Stonecutters, he will control our lives. Maybe. But maybe we don't wanna be Stonecutters no more. This is much better than the old Stonecutter hall. Silence. I now call to order the first meeting... of the ancient, mystic society of... No Homers. Hey, fellas. Can I join? Sorry. No Homers. Loyal Stonecutters... let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg. Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites. Oh, Marge, kids, I miss my club. Oh, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club. The Black Panthers? No, the family Simpson... which has just five members. And only two of those members have special rings. Yeah! Yeah! I meant our wedding rings! You know, Marge, you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to. This club better be worth it. All right, all right, it's Lisa's turn. Who controls the British crown? Who keeps the metric system down? We do We do. Who keeps Atlantis off the maps? Who keeps the Martians under wraps? We do We do. Who holds back the electric car? Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star? We do We do. Who robs cavefish of their sight? Who rigs every Oscar night? We do. We do. Shut up.
#06x13 - And Maggie Makes Three^We now return to. Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat. Faster, Knightboat. Gotta catch those starfish poachers. Don't have to yell, Michael. I'm all around you. Oh, no. They're headed for land. We'll never catch them now. Incorrect. Look, a canal. Go, Knightboat, go. Every week, there's a canal. Or an inlet. Or a fjord. Quiet! I won't hear another word against the boat. Okay, TV off. It's family time. But, Marge... Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat. Homer, you promised, one night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example. Says you, woman. Hey, what are you doing? Mom. All right, family time begins now. Homer. It was Bart. Why don't we all look at the photo album. So many memories. Oh, look, Knightboat. And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two. Two. Two. Yeah, yeah, two. Let's get to the baby pictures. Mom. That's exciting. Oh, please. Here's Bart sleeping. Here he is dozing. Here he is after a visit from the sandman. Here's nappy time, Bart. Here's a cute one. He's all tuckered out. Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie? Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story. It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age. And, Lisa... you were the age Bart was several years ago. Get the camera ready, Bart very sleepy. Listen carefully, and my words will shape images... as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear-beverage craze gave us all a reason to live. The information superhighway showed the average person... what some nerd thinks about Star Trek. And the domestication of the dog continued unabated. I was at my workstation when suddenly... Attention, American workers. Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of freelance terrorists. Not on my shift! No, you don't. Simpson, 10, terrorists, 8. Homer, tell the story right. Okay. Homer, you should see a doctor. I don't think a healthy man can make that kind of smell. Your paychecks, gentlemen. This is it. With a single glorious check... I'm finally completely out of debt. Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job. But, Homer, how you gonna make a living? Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good. Hey, what did we do? Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss you. Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want. Is that so? Lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone... oh, I don't know, didn't use a coaster! Such a nice, tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig! Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head! Oh, I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms. Go, Homer. Yeah. Yeah. Way to play the boss's head like a bongo, Homer. He's getting a pretty good sound out of that guy. That's for employing me for eight years. And that is that. Goodbye, mind-numbing, backbreaking labor forever. Hello, dream job in paradise. And now, the final phase of my plan. Barney, any chance you can get me a job? Hey. Sure, Homer. I told you, my uncle owns the place. Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job? Sure. Barney, you're fired. Okay. Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants. Why? When it happens, you'll know. You're a pin monkey? Finally, I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job. It's romantic, throwing off the shackles of the workaday world... and following a dream, of sorts. I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin monkey's salary? Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa... if we make a few small sacrifices. From now on, we use regular toilet paper... not that fancy quilted kind. And only one of you kids can go to college. Fine. Fine. That night, your mom and I went out for a romantic evening... to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing. Followed by a stroll on the beach. Marge. Homer. I've got sand in my underpants. Me too. Let's go home. I love you, Marge. I love you too, Homie. Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever. Did you have to be so graphic? It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school. Dad, were you excited that Mom was pregnant? Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed. Dad! Dad! Hi, Maggie. So anyhow, back then there was no way for me to know... your mother was pregnant. Hey. Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've gotta wash my hair. The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma. Hey, Homer. Hi there, Homer. Hi, Homer. Hi there, Homer. Hi. Bowling-fresh. Urinal-fresh. Homer, did you polish your head in the Shine-O Ball-O? No. Okay, then. I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley... like where the pins go after they're knocked down. I was in heaven. If horseracing is the sport of kings... then surely, bowling... is a very good sport as well. Hey, great job, Homer. Thanks a lot, Homer. Hey, you're the best. I'm gonna make it after all. Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson. You're pregnant. Am I to take it that this is... an unwanted pregnancy? Oh, no, no. Not exactly. It's just that I haven't told Homer yet. With his new job... I don't know how we'll be able to afford this. Well, you know, a healthy baby can bring upwards of $60,000. What?! Of course, that was just a test. Had you reacted differently, why, you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test. So in a few months, both of you will have a brand-new brother or sister. Been there, done that. I hope it's a girl. You know nothing about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl. You're worried about telling Dad. Why do you say that? Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now. Hey, I'm just hanging. Homie, l... Can't talk. Praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me, and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect... just the way it is. So here's the deal: You freeze everything as it is... and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done. I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way... and at just the right time. Until then, please keep this to yourselves. If he found out now, it would probably destroy him, huh? Oh, yes. Gotta go. Gotta go. Wait a minute. Wait. I know that look. Now, promise you won't tell Homer. Oh, we promise we won't tell... Homer. Hello. Is this A. Aaronson? It might interest you to know that Marge Simpson is pregnant again. Just thought you'd like to know, Mr. Zowkowski. There. Aaronson and Zowkowski are the two biggest gossips in town. In an hour, everyone will know. Another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job. Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer. Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work. Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir. It's true, the bundle is little... but I'm not in it for the money. Hey, Homer, way to get Marge pregnant. This is getting very abstract, but thank you... I do enjoy working at the bowling alley. Surprise! Baby shower. Baby shower? You know I haven't told Homer yet. And he'll be home any minute. Oh, really? Oh, really? Man, it's windy as hell out there. Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're... showering Marge with gifts. With little, tiny baby-sized gifts. Well, I'll be in the tub. By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer. New job? Marge is pregnant?! No! Dad, you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl? Oh, just that one time. Actually, when I was about to have Bart... You're pregnant?! And then when I told him about Lisa... You're pregnant again?! Who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb... threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday. Where are you going? You can't expect a person... to sit for 30 minutes straight. I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom. I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase. I don't have that. You're pregnant. We're gonna have to have a baby. All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed. Doomed, I tells you! Bart, let your father tell the story. Yeah. Okay, but I know funny. Anyhoo... We're doomed! Homer, you had a head. Check. And your bottom was a little bigger. You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise. Yeah, a raise. I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it. I'm gonna march right up to Al and say: Steve. I mean, Al, I think I deserve a raise. You're a hard worker. I'd like to give you a raise. But the alley just ain't doing enough business to pay that kind of money. How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise? Well, yeah, but... Of course. Bowling. Bowling here. Come bowl now. Get your bowling. Who's ready? Bowling. Mom, make Dad tell the story right. That's what really happened. My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials... but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done. You did a great job, Homer. I'm really gonna miss you. Place has never been cleaner. And the way you kept the young people away, that was beautiful. Oh, yeah. Thanks for that. Anyway, we all pitched in, and we got you this little going-away thing. This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey. See you around, Mr. Homer. Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California someday. Sure, we will, Mr. Homer. Sure, we will. It's gonna be sad around here without you, Homer. Yeah. Sure is. Boy, this is depressing. I know what'd cheer us up. Bowling. Look at this, I got a ball here. I feel happy now. Hey. Boy, this is fun. I needed more money to support my growing family. And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it. Acid rain again. Yes? Are you a new applicant? I quit, and I came to get my job back. Through there. So come crawling back, eh? Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it. Thanks for giving me my old job back. I'm afraid it's not that simple. As punishment for your desertion... it's company policy to give you the plague. Sir, that's the "plaque." Yes, the special de-motivational plaque... to break what's left of your spirit. Because, you see, you're here forever. "Don't forget: You're here forever." I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've gotta carry the burden all by myself. Hi, honey. How are you? Well, actually... Oh, I can't go on with this charade. I hate my job. I hate my life. Since I found out about this baby, there's been only bad luck. My contractions started an hour ago. Just in one ear and out the other with you, isn't it? This is incredible. It's God's most wondrous miracle. Sir, I think your wife wants to hold the baby. My wife? Where? Where? Congratulations. It's a boy. You're truly the catch of the day. It's wonderful. It's magical. Oh, boy. Here it comes, another mouth. One more push should do it. Marvelous. Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby. Okay. Homie, I think someone is saying hello. Hello. It's a boy. And what a boy! That's the umbilical cord. It's a girl. A girl. Oh, Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl. Not just a girl. The most beautiful baby girl in the whole world. Come on, Marge, show a little enthusiasm. So you loved her right from the start. Absolutely. Then why no pictures? Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up.
#06x14 - Bart's Comet^And now, to top off... our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever... our grand finale: The launching of a weather balloon. Go, weather balloon! Hurrah for science, whoo! "Hurrah for science, whoo"? I can't say I approve of the "whoo," but the "hurrah" was quite heartening. Release the balloon. Yeah! All right! No! I don't think I really captured the eyes. Bart, if you have a failing... it's that you're always demanding perfection. If you have a failing. Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions. Careful, children. That's my car. Destroy that balloon. Aye. Tango 14, we're being fired at. I'm getting an ID on the bogey now. Iraqis again. Launching Sidewinder missile. Missed him. Launching second Sidewinder missile. This is what happens when you cut money out of the military... and put it into healthcare. It's a good program. Just give it a chance, that's all I ask. It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules César Janssen. Now to find out who did this. Bart, empty your pockets. Empty my pockets, you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how... Blueprints of the dummy, notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner. Race you to Utah, Milhouse. Okay. I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time. Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning. There's a 4:30 in the morning now? Top of the hour, time for the news. But of course, there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds. Good night, everybody. Mom, will you make me breakfast? There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. Just rinse it good. Come on, Lassie. Here, boy. Come on, girl. Attaboy. Still dark. Better use the generator. There's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet... writing down numbers, paying attention. Science has it all. Is that the telescope we'll look through? Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about. There's Orion, the Swan, the Chariot Race. Why don't they look anything like their names? You do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men. Who names these things? Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I can find something... that would be named after me. You've never found anything? Once. But by the time I got to a phone... my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him, though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway, that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping... a square of sky that's thought to be empty. I hope it's not. So, what am I supposed to do exactly? Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 22 minutes declination. No sighting. Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 23 minutes declination. No sighting. Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 58 minutes declination. No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart? Hell, no. Good. My stars. Give me the phone, quick. Check out 6-19-14-59. No. No, there's no need for that. It's already named after me. It's pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation... can destroy a whole morning's work. All hands on deck. Pirates off the port bow. Hey. Observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something in the sky at 4-12-8, and the last number is seven. Got you, my rumpy doppelgänger. I've got it. What are you doing? Give me that phone. Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet. No! No! No! And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate. Sounds like you had a good day, Dad. Yeah. Except I forgot to go to work. What did you do today, Bart? What didn't I do? "Boy Discovers Comet." What? "A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet... to be known as the Bart Simpson Comet." Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. But then you've always been proud of me. Yes. Won't you join us, Bart? I guess so. As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet... we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to Super Friends! Welcome, Super Friend! I am called Ham, since I enjoy Ham Radio. This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card, Database and Lisa. Your nickname will be Cosmos. Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye. Goodbye, Cosmos. Bye-bye. Perhaps some night you could show us your comet. There it is right there. I make it a point... never turn my head unless I expect to see something. Naturally, we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope. But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there. Oh, no, no! This isn't right at all! It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed. Don't you realize what's happening? Your comet will collide with Earth. Everything in its path will be killed. I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet. You've always been petty and small, right from the beginning. We must alert the proper authorities. To the observatory! We are the Super Friends. Hey, shut up. Dear God! Warren... we've talked about you hogging the eyepiece. Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle. Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years. Trouble a-brewing. Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis... I caught the very next plane to Springfeld. Field. First, yes, there is a comet in the sky. And yes, it is going to hit Springfield. You don't need to applaud that. Now, here's what we think the impact might look like. Show them, Jerry. Oh, dear God, no! Fortunately, we have a plan. Professor Frink? Hi. Good evening, ladies and... Einstein, what's the plan?! All right, just take your seat. Now, working with former Carter-administration officials... and military men who were forced into early retirement... For various reasons which we won't go into here, okay? We have planned this defense for the city. As the comet hurdles toward the city, our rocket will intercept it... and blow it to smithereens. Right! That will be the end of our Mr. Comet. We're saved! Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what that guy in the building said? But, Dad, don't you think...? Lisa. The reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain-forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it, didn't they? No, Dad. I don't think... There's that word again. Homer, what if this doesn't work? Well, then I have a backup plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around... twiddling their thumbs and going: Dad! The plan. I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going: Dad! So anyway, we get in our car... and take the bridge out of town. While all the while, they're still going: Dad, they're firing the rocket! All right! It blew up the bridge! We're doomed! It's times like this I wish I were a religious man. It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer! And like lcarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high... and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism... leaving us with some... six hours to live. So let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town... with Arnie Pie and "Arnie in the Sky." With the bridge gone and the airport on the other side of the bridge... a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars. It's a silent testament to the never-give-up... and never-think-things-out spirit of our citizens. With our annihilation imminent, our government has snapped into action. We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress. Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill... to evacuate the town of Springfield... in the great state of... Wait a second. I wanna tack on a rider to that bill. Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts. All in favor of the amended Springfield/pervert bill? Bill defeated. I've said it before and I'll say it again, democracy simply doesn't work. Now, over the years a newsman learns a number of things... that for one reason or another he just cannot report. It doesn't seem to matter now, so... The following people are gay. Turn it off. Just a second. What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left... will be no bigger than a Chihuahua's head. Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow. Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter. We have a bomb shelter? Homer Simpson takes care of his family. Flanders, open up! Hidy-ho-a-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for? Get out of there. My family needs your bomb shelter. Homer. I kind of figured this might happen. So I built the shelter big enough for both families. No deal. Out. Get in the shelter, Homer. One more hour. An hour? I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet? There it is. Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your shelterinies by now? We haven't got shelterinies. We want in yours. Well, sorry. Shelter's kind of full. Really? Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks. Wait. You know, I may regret this when our air runs out... and we can't whistle or stay alive, but, oh, what the hey. All right. I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's gonna have to get out. I'd get out, but I don't know where I am. Hey, somebody's touching me. I am. Oh, okay. Okay, okay. Let's figure out who should stay. Let's see. In the world of the future, we'll need laughter, so I'm in. And it'll need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. Me. And someone will have to run the power. You can do that, Homer. Yeah. I can do that. Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip. That's Mrs. Lovejoy. Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: Left-handed stores. That's you, Flanders! I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry. Well, sir, sounds fair. Toodle-loo, everybody. I'll scream when the comet gets here. Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddie. No, sweetheart. You... You stay here, because... Okay. I might go mad with fear out there, so, Todd... I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in. Okay, Dad. Okay. Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and you all try to guess what it is. It's a pig. It's a cow, man. It's a pony. No, it's a goat. You know, one of them lady goats. There are no lady goats. A lady goat is a sheep. I believe she's right. You're crazy. What's it to you? What's it to me? Hey, it's a pony! Shut up! Doesn't anybody care that I'm hungry? Stop it, stop it. Can't you see this barnyard-noise guessing game... is tearing us apart? Say, Moe, was it a duck? I don't like it... No! No! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it! Stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm going out there. And it was a baby ox. He's right, you know. About the ox? About everything, damn it! Hey, Homer, wait up. I wanna die too. If you are going, I am going. Me too. Me too. I'm out of here. Make way. Radio reception in there sucked. Run! Look! It's breaking up! Cool. We're saved! Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life. Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again. I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've picketed against... is what burned up the comet. What's really amazing... is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen. Yeah. Dad was right. I know, kids. I'm scared too.
#06x15 - Homie the Clown^When Krusty wants to, he can still blow them away. Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle... and make it funny. See you tomorrow, kids. But before I go, I'd just like to say... There's nothing better than a cigarette... unless it's a cigarette lit with a $ 100 bill. Put 5000 bucks on the Lakers. Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator. My house is dirty. Buy me a clean one. Krusty, as your accountant, I must warn you... Did you send 1000 roses... to Bea Arthur's grave? Yes. But she's... I don't wanna hear the end of sentences. George Carlin on three. Yeah. Lawsuit? Oh, come on. My "Seven Words You Can't Say on TV" bit... was entirely different from your bit. So I'm a thief, am I? Well, excuse me! Give him 10 grand. Steve Martin on four. Ten grand. Krusty, in regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's horse race... Come on. How about letting me go double or nothing on the opera tonight. Who do you like? The tenor. Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride... because you crack us so consistently up. You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty. No can do. And those ridiculous bets you make. Gambling is the finest thing a person can do if he's good at it. You haven't won anything in months. So I'll just make more money. Crank out some merchandise. You already merchandised everything. Krusty's Monopoly game, the Krusty Crowd-Control Barrier. Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new Lady Krusty line. But our infomercials are running 24 hours a day. So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Mustache-Removal System, Angelique? It's Krusterrific, Johnny Unitas. But is my upper lip supposed to bleed like this? Probably. At this rate, you'll be broke in a month. Only thing left to do is... to open a clown college and train some regional Krustys. You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown? Exactly. Forget it. I'll just cut back on the condor-egg omelets. A couple of those would be tasty right now. I'll found the college tomorrow. It must be the first of the month. New Billboard Day! Finders, keepers. "This year, give her English muffins." Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard. "Best in the West." That rhymes. Clown college. You can't eat that. I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college, though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever. Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire. Clowns are funny. Mom? I think I'll have some wine. Marge? Yes, Homie. That's it. You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college. I don't think any of us expected him to say that. Hurry up. It's my first day of clown college. Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm. I am holding still. I am squirming. Dad, you can't go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight... the pratfall and the seltzer bottle, as far as I know. Yeah, Dad. It was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty... You didn't complain when I got you... this close to Chachi. What's a chachi? All right. Now, there can only be one Krusty in each territory. So I hope this works out. Tell me where you're from. Georgia. Texas. Brooklyn. Russia. New Hampshire. Homer. Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p... Wha...? Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy! I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life. Okay. Memorize these funny place names: Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga... Seattle. Stop it. You're killing me. Seattle. And now, everybody's favorite, the Spin-Cycle Fantastic trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off. But if you blow it, you'll look like a fool. Steady. Steady. Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong. "Kill wealthy dowager." Burn that seat. These Krusty-brand balloons are 3 bucks each. Get a cheap one, and what happens? Goes off! Takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost you? Hey, Bill. What did that cost us? I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad. If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you. Thanks, honey. Bank shot! That's good aim, Dad. Well, it was my major. Welcome to the noble family of skilled Krustaceans. You'll now go back to your hometowns and do kids' parties, swap meets... and the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot clown pole. Now come and get your catskins... I mean, sheepskins. This is the happiest day of my life... Got it. No shock for me. Oh, yeah? And now, to help introduce our fantastic new burger, the one with ketchup... here he is, coming in by parachute, Krusty the Clown. "To audience. I now proclaim this new burger for sale." Lord, save me. It's the Krusty Burglar. Oh, my God. He's stealing all the burgers. Why, you little... Homer. Homer, it's all just an act. Stop. Stop. He's already dead. Sir. Sir. I gotta get him. Get him. Krusty the Clown, everybody. Please look at my MedicAlert bracelet. Hey, hey. And then take that and... put that in there and... here's your giraffe, little girl. I'm a boy. That's the spirit. Never give up. Well, I guess you're pretty impressed, huh, Bart? My dad got Krusty the Clown to personally appear at my party. I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house. I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty big wheel down at the cracker factory. It's not 5:30 yet. Hey, nice threads. I'm beat. And after work, I gotta dedicate a new Jiffy Lube and cohost the ACE Awards. Wow, Jiffy Lube. Boy, you're running yourself ragged. Yeah. When I started this clown thing, I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown. I tell you, it's hard, tiring work. But when I see the smiles on their little faces... I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something. Well, my time's almost up here. So I'd like to say I know Woody Allen. And now, the winner for the most promising new series on cable: Old Starsky and Hutch's. Accepting the award is the son of the guy who played Huggy Bear. Let's walk and talk. I have wonderful stories about other famous people... that include me in some way. Can't. Gotta distract bulls at a rodeo. Hey, me too. We can go together. No. I'm going a different way than you, Dick. Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I had dinner with Groucho and... You're gonna have dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it. Being a clown sucks. Kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to the other clowns in the clowning business. Oh, no. Well, well, well, velocity boy. I'm gonna give you the biggest ticket you... Hey, Krusty! I'm not Krusty. To think I was gonna give you a ticket. Krusty the Clown. I am not Krusty. Hey, Krusty, Krusty. You remember the time we got loaded... and set those beavers loose in that pine-furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty. Hey, he didn't give me a ticket. This is an intriguing development. You mean I get 5 percent off everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the Clown? How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines... kept me in business during that first shaky year? Oh, by the way, here is your new issue of Gigantic Asses. I'm telling you, this'll work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been getting free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint. Look at it. I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest. Lf we agree, then why are we arguing? Hey, Krusty, hey. Beautiful date tonight, huh? And such lovely children you have now. I'm more striking than lovely. You come with me. Come with Luigi. You don't want to sit with the rest of the scum. Hey. What's going on? I only consider you scum compared to Krusty. Well, I can see that. Yeah, you see how you scum. Let me get this straight. You took money made franchising your name... and bet it against the Harlem Globetrotters? Oh, I thought the Generals were due. He's spinning the ball on his finger. Just take it. Take the ball. That game was fixed. They were using a freaking ladder, for God's sake. I am afraid the time has come for you to pay us. Look, I'm cleaned out. Just take the clown college. We have already taken it. Kids have a lot of money these days. So after you finish your performance, you might consider robbing them. What can I tell you? You can't get blood from a turnip. You wanna kill me, go ahead and kill me. Hey, all right, okay already. Look, we can talk this over. No more talk. It is time for us to take you for a ride. Oh, no... Mind if I go to the bathroom first? I see no harm in that. When he's done in there, I gotta go. Okay, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him. Legs, you check out the East Side. Louie, Rome and Budapest. Tell the boys I want a total world search. Right, boss. Right, boss. I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the Clown. Get it? Krusty. Cancel the world search. I want everything that's coming to Krusty the Clown, which is me, Krusty. Hey, it's Krusty, all right. Should I shoot him gangland-style or execution-style? Listen to your heart. Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty. But I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only $38,000. Hey, what are all these holes? Speed holes. They make the car go faster. Oh, yeah. Speed holes. You want my advice? I think you should buy this car. We need more ammo. Let's go to Big 5. Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete. Now, when I remove the bandages... don't be alarmed by the total stranger staring back at you. I look exactly the same, you moron! Oh, nonsense, Krusty. You look at least 10 years younger. Plus, I did your breasts. Hear me complaining about the breasts? Oh, what's the use in hiding? I gotta go back to Springfield and face the music. Can you loan me bus fare? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What you diddily doing, neighbor? I'm putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster. Is that so? Well, gee, maybe the old Flanders-mobile could use... Wow, lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart... Lucky I was wearing this extra-large piece of the true cross today. I think I'll go inside. What keeps doing that? I told you we should've bought more than three bullets. Let's just grab him. Hey! But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson. The same Homer Simpson who... crashed his car through the wall of our club? Actually, my name is Barney. Yeah, Barney Gumble. The same Barney Gumble who keeps taking pictures of my sister? Actually, my real name is... Think, Krusty, think. Joe Valachi. Same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate committee about organized crime? Benedict Arnold. The same Benedict Arnold... who plotted to surrender West Point to the hated British? I am so glad I had a chance to meet you... before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great fan. Don Vittorio Dimaggio. Krusty the Clown. Sorry I have to do this, Krusty. I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick, where you ride the little bike through the loop... and I will let you live. But I've never been able to do the... Hey, how about if I squirt you in the face with my boutonnière? Okay. I'll never be able to do this trick. Never. Go. Go. Hey. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm the greatest clown in the world. The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest insult of all. Hey, guys. I came to... Oh, you got a deadly game of cat and mouse going. I'll come back. I'm seeing double here. Four Krustys. Krusty. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. You came here to save me. Yeah. That's what I did. My apologies to you. I almost made a grievous error. Goodbye, Krusty. Wait. He can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one's the real Krusty. I am confused. Good one, Krusty. Oh, crap. Because of that disrespectful display... I shall now kill both of you. Unless you both go through the loop together. I can't see, you idiot. Take your hands off my eyes. Hey. Not bad. Without the loop, it is nothing. Yeah, Krustys! Grazie. Grazie. You have brought great joy to this old ltalian stereotype. No, no, Don Vittorio. You're not... Yes, I am. I know it. I am. Anyway, thank you, Krusty. Oh, you're welcome. So we're even now, huh? No, we just won't kill you. But you still owe us the money. Forty-eight dollars. Here's 50. And 2, your change. And we thank you.
#06x16 - Bart vs. Australia^Go, toothpaste. Go! Move your pasty, white butt! Come on, shampoo! You can do it! I won your stupid bathroom-products race! No fair. You only won because you had the inside track. If the water had spun the other way... It never spins the other way. In the Northern Hemisphere... water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect. No way. Water doesn't obey your rules. It goes where it wants. Like me, babe. Yes, Bart. Why don't you try it and see. I know I've seen it go the other way. Ah, faithful toilet. You'll prove me right. I'm singing in the show... Hot! Cold! Hot! Cold! Hot! Who's doing that? Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart, use the plunger. Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere. What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere? Haven't you ever looked at your globe? See? The Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the equa... This line. So down there in, say, Argentina... or Rand McNally, all their water runs backwards? In fact, in Rand McNally, they wear hats on their feet... and hamburgers eat people. Cool. Hello, Southern Hemisphere? Which way does the water go in your toilet? Just a minute, I'll check. Nuts. Please to repeat again, and I will translating for the el presidente. Which way does the water turn in your toilet? I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere. Nuisance phone. Bart, you can't actually call these places. Don't you know how expensive international calls are? Hello, operator, I'd like to make a collect call... to Australia. This is the operator. Will you accept a collect call from...? Yes, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of the lnternational Drainage Commission. It's an emergency. Lf it's an emergency... We understand drains in your area have malfunctioned... sucking in people and whatnot. Willikers! That's awful! Indeed. We need you to check your sinks and toilets... and tell us which way the water is going. And please stand clear! The fixtures, they're all draining clockwise, sir. She was right. Stupid Lisa, science queen. Well, why don't you just check your neighbors' drains. I'll hold. Hey, Bart, the bakery caught fire and all of downtown smells like cookies. Want to go smell? Yes. Yes, I do. Hello, sir? Sir? I've returned from the Quilamaguery's place. They're draining clockwise too. Draining? I don't care about that anymore. Are we in any dang... "Burkina Faso"? "Disputed Zone"? Who called all these weird places? Quiet, it might be you. I can 't remember. No, I'm gonna ask Marge. No! No! Why embarrass us both? Just write a check and I'll release some more endorphins. Nine hundred dollary-doos?! Tobias! Did you accept a six-hour collect call from the States? It was an emergency call... from the lnternational Drainage Commission in Springfield. Oh, my God! There's nothing wrong with the bidet, is there? Hello? Right, I'm calling all the way... from Squatter's Crog, Australia. And I want to speak to Dr. Bart Simpson right now. Hold, please. All right, but I don't... Hello. Burt Stanton speaking. I said, Bart Simpson! What kind of company is this? Bart Simpson's office. Thank the great, good Lord. Look, I was just saying... One moment, please. Who do they think I am, some stupid Aussie drongo? Bleeding Yanks. I ought to... This is Bart Simpson. Can I help you, ma'am? Yeah... My name is Bruno Drundridge, right. You owe me $900, mate! No, you owe me $900! All right, you... You're just some punk kid, aren't you? You picked the wrong guy to tangle with here, mate. I don't think so. You're all the way in Australia. Hey, I think I hear a dingo eating your baby. That's it! I'm gonna report this to me member of Parliament. Hey, Gus! I got something to report to you! That's a bloody outrage, it is! I'm gonna take this all the way to the prime minister! Hey, Mr. Prime Minister! Andy! Aye, mates. What's the good word? "Mr. Simpson," blah, blah. "Misrepresentation over telephone..." "Sincerely," some Australian jerk. Hey, I need that! "Office of the Solicitor General"? "Office of the Prime Minister"? "Hopping Mad Collection Agency"? What is all this stuff? Nothing. Some stupid country thinks I owe them money. Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this. Hey, guys? Just so you don't hear any wild rumors, I'm being indicted... for fraud in Australia. That's no reason to block the TV. Oh, my. Bart, did you trick an Australian boy into accepting a $900 collect call? Yes'm. There it is, Australia. I'll be damned. Look at this country. "You-are-gay." Oh, my. Hello. I'm Evan Conover with the U.S. State Department. "Undersecretary for lnternational Protocol, Brat and Punk Division." Unfortunately, your little escapade could not have come at a worse time. Americo-Australianian relations are at an all-time low. In the late 1980s, the U.S. Experienced a short-lived infatuation... with Australian culture. The Aussies thought this would be permanent. I know those words, but that sign makes no sense. Anyway, the down-under fad fizzled, and the diplomatic climate... turned absolutely frosty. Let's pretend we didn't see that. And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further. Oh, he'll agitate you. He sure will. What can we do for you? It's too late... to pay back the money. But as a sign of good faith to our Australian friends... we'd like to imprison Bart for five years. That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man. No, no, no! I'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia. You'll just have to find some other country to have relations with. You're sure, now? The prison train is sailing. Okay, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. There is one other option. They'll drop the charges if Bart makes a public apology in Australia. All Bart has to do is apologize and we get a free trip to Australia? I can handle that. I'm an expert at phony apologies. Bart! I'm sorry. That's better. We left at 1:30 p.m., Monday. What time is it now? It's 6:45 a.m., next Wednesday. You may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter. What does that sign say? I thought they spoke English in this country. It says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. Any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance. Sorry, girl, I don't want to get in any more trouble down here. I'll pick you up on the way home. Hey, are you, like, one of those English guards... who can't laugh or smile or anything? No, sir! U.S. Marine Corps, sir! Oh, yeah. This is the life. Boy, next summer can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida? I'm way ahead of you, Dad. Knock. Simpsons, I'd like you to meet our ambassador... the Honorable Averil Ward. Hello. Now, everything is all set for Bart's apology. Mr. Conover will meet you at the Parliament House at 3 p.m. Any questions? Do the toilets go backwards in here? No. To combat homesickness, we have a device that makes... them swirl the correct American way. Sweet land of liberty. Of thee I sing. Hey, GI Joe, your sign's broken. We're already in Australia. Actually, sir, the embassy is considered American soil, sir. Really? Look, boy. Now I'm in Australia. Now I'm in America. Australia. America. Australia. I get it, Dad. Homer, that's enough. Here in America, we don't tolerate that crap, sir. "Australia was founded as a settlement for British convicts." Lisa, watch your camera. You call that a knife? This is a knife. That's not a knife. That's a spoon. All right, all right. You win. I see you've played knifie-spoonie before. Hey, give me one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about. Something wrong, Yank? No. It's pretty big, I guess. I'll just have a cup of coffee. Beer it is. No, I said, coffee. Beer? Coffee. Beer? C-O... B-E... We'll meet you boys back here for dinner. Good luck, honey. Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your public humiliation. But the Walambaloo Dirt Monument is just too exciting to pass up. Hear ye! Hear ye! This session will now come to order. With the cooperation of the U.S. Department of State... we have present today one Bart Simpson. I believe he has something to say. Bart? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did to your country. Well, you're free to go, Bart... right after your additional punishment. Punishment! A mere apology would be a bit empty. Let the booting begin! Booting? It's just a little kick in the bum. What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot? Mr. Simpson, shush. Disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. It's one of their proudest traditions. You sold us out, Conover! Stand back or I'll boot your prime minister! I'll do it. So help me God, I'll boot him! When will you Australians learn? In America, we stopped using corporal punishment. And things have never been better. The streets are safe... old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys... and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer-programming abilities. So like us, let your children run wild and free... because, as the old saying goes: "Let your children run wild and free." Now, boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil! I'll stop them. Oh, no, it's coming back this way. That throwing stick stunt of yours has boomeranged on us. Hey, we can get away in their pouches. It's not like in cartoons. Yeah. There's a lot more mucus. Mom, you said I could have one souvenir, right? Well, I want a didjeridu. That seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. Why don't you get this nice cap. It's clever, just like you. Get out! Get out! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! These bloody things are everywhere. They're in the lift, the lorry... in the bon whizzer, and the Malonga Gilderchuck. They're like kangaroos. But they're reptiles, they is. We have them in America. They're called bullfrogs. What? That's an odd name. I'd have called them chazwazzers. Lisa! Marge! The Simpsons. Well, they're not getting back in here. I can't believe our government would set up Bart like that. I'm very angry at the State Department right now. Yes, but... Please, we're about to reach a breakthrough with the Aussies. Then it's agreed. During the bargaining session, we each get two candy apples. All right, one candy and one caramel. Oh, for the love of criminy! Give me that! I know Bart did something wrong. But he's my son... and I'm going to punish him myself. Our countries may have their differences... but as human beings, I think we can all agree... there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent. He wants to talk to you. Hello. So we're in agreement. She won't be allowed near the phone again. We did it. We've worked out a compromise that will allow both nations to save face. We've argued them down to... a booting. What? The prime minister just wants to kick you once through the gate... with a regular shoe. I believe it's a wingtip. No deal. This is my son we're talking about. Sure, he's not perfect, but who is in this workaday world? No. Mom, wait. It's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny. Thank you, Bart. I promise I won't make fun of you later for this. Show them what American butts are made of, son. That's it, lad. This is for the Commonwealth of Australia. And this is for the United States of America. I'm glad you're okay, honey. But I wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic. I'm impressed you were able to write so legibly on your own butt. All right, mates, let them have it! Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier? No, sir. The closest vessel is the USS Walter Mondale. It's a laundry ship. They'll take you the rest of the way. Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops. Well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species... into an ecosystem that can't handle them.
#06x17 - Homer vs. Patty and Selma^This place is gonna smell classy all week. To Homer, the Wall Street genius! Hey, Homer, how come you got money to burn? Or singe, anyway. Yeah, what's your secret investment? Take a guess. Pumpkins? Yeah, that's right, Barney. This year, I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October. And I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang! That's when I'll cash in. To Homer! And to Sergeant Pepper... who's growing out of the middle of your back! Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke these. Hey, Homer. Yeah! Hey, Homer. Way to go. I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween. Let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling a liver. I can get by with one. Oh, how am I gonna tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle. My house is on fire! Insurance to the rescue! Hello, Homer. Hello, Homer. Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after 6, and I stop eating your lipstick. This is a special occasion. Patty and Selma just got promoted at the DMV. Yeah, Homer. Let your wife have a glimpse of success for once. All right, that's the last straw. Time to take out the trash! But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude. He's just a very complicated man. Wrong! When are you going to wake up and smell your husband, Marge? You got some kids out of him. But when the seeds have been planted, you throw away the envelope. I wish you wouldn't put Homer down. He may not be a big success like you... but I can always count on him to provide for the family. Sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow. Hello, Vegas? Give me a hundred bucks on red. All right. I'll send you a check. If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked... Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. This invention of yours has made us all rich, especially you. It's simple, yet ingenious. And it fits right in the palm of your hand. Every person in America now owns one of these. In many cases, three or four. Can I just get a look at that? Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented the product. But could I just...? Don't worry. You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign. Let me see! Out of the way! Homer! Homer, wake up! There's still a few minutes till our usual bedtime. No! My invention! My money problems could've... Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble? Oh, Marge, my loyal wife... of course not. And Lisa, my little princess. And who could forget dear Rat Boy? Rat Boy? I resent that. Bart, I told you before. Stop gnawing on the drywall. What a day, eh, Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing... bees are trying to have s*x with them, as I understand it. It is a gorgeously fabulous day. Marvelous, even. So, what's your hurry to get to school? Nothing. What's your hurry? That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun, but if we're late, we'll get in trouble. You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun. Attention, students. It's time to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's prove how adult we can be... by filing to the gym in a calm, orderly manner. Even though it's first come, first serve, and the popular sports fill up fast. Too many wee ones! This gets uglier every year. Any sign of Bart and Milhouse? No, and if they don't get here soon, it'll be T.S. For them. I don't feel right. Do you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell! "Truant! Truant! Truant!" They'll all say! Who needs him? I can have fun all by myself. It's all right? It's all right. It's all right? It's all right. Sure, Homer, I can loan you the money you need. However, since you have no collateral... I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance. Gosh, Moe. I use these all the time. Couldn't you bash my head in? Hey, are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? Now, let's do this thing. Oh, no. It's P.E. Sign-up day. How could you forget? They had signs posted all over the library. Better sign up for something fast, man. Baseball just filled up... So did tae kwon do. There's only one class left... but it happens to be the coolest one of all. Ballet? Dancing is for girls. Well, you should've gotten here earlier. I need an extension on my mortgage payments. I understand, Mr. Simpson, but according to our computer... your credit history is not good. It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you grabbed a dog by the hind legs... and pushed him like a vacuum. In the third grade! It all goes on your permanent record. Sorry, but if you don't have that money by tomorrow... the bank will take your house. Good luck finding it. I'll take the numbers off. We'll find a house with no numbers. I'll take off my neighbor's numbers. So then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers. All right, you'll get your money. You're my last, last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot... wish you would, but probably won't, final resort to lend me money. We'll take care of you. Yes. Care. Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here. What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Get a picture of me with this steak. You're certainly in a good mood, Dad. Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair. Slanty. Patty, Selma. What are you doing here? We thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner. Now, bring us extra chairs like a good "blubber"-in-law. Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple of 500-pound bags should do it! Be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle. That's okay, Marge. Nothing's broke. Except Homer. What's that supposed to mean? It means... It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner. Now, there's a stink I could've done without. This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner. It calls for a celebration. I'll make the most international coffee in the house: Montreal Morn. All right, you had your fun, now get lost. Our fun hasn't begun yet. We know something you don't want Marge to know. Now we own you, like Siegfried owns Roy. I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafé. I'm very, very sorry. Oh, Marge, Marge. You're just in time. Homer's getting ready to give us a foot rub. You are? No! L... I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that. You can start with the corns. Then you can move on to bunion country. Okay. Steady, Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man. All right, girls. Today we learn the dance of the fairy queens. You can either be a fairy or a queen. It's wide open. And what have we here? A young man maybe who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov. I don't wanna be the next anything. They made me take this stupid class. So he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly fire... to be the next Baryshnikov! Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies. Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the determined. But for the sissies, never. Now, put on this fuchsia-tard. You are a fairy! Quitting time. On the way home... we'll stop at Moe's for a Zima. Maybe I'll stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again. Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity. Pull yourself together and come get drunk with us. Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson? I don't like wearing tights. But so many of your heroes wear tights. Batman, for example. And Magellan. Look, I don't like this cootie platoon... and I never will. I'm out of here, and I'm out of this stupid outfit. Wait! Joy of movement, increasing. Love of dance, impossible to resist. Toes twinkling. Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet. And I love it! Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here? Request permission to slink by. Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes. But you're already smoking cig... You're really pushing it. Come on, Homer. You can't spell "obsequious" without l-O-U. I'll have to trust you on that. Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her. No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good. Just for that, you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are. But... Yes, ma'am. Now say, "I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog. " In a dog voice! I am Homer Simpson. Well, good. Jump, Homer, jump. What's going on in here? Absolutely nothing, Marge. What's that paper? What paper? Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters? I don't know, Marge. I can't keep track of all my wheelings and dealings. He blew your savings on jack-o'-lanterns. You told! Sorry, Marge. I never want to see you again! You either. Homer. Homer, why didn't you tell me? I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider. And at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you wanna sleep on the couch tonight. How's Dad today? Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table. Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it. But I like to make you breakfast. In that case, I'll just have French toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar. See that? I started to do, like, a little arabesque. But then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechat. Not that I'm into that kind of thing. Bravissimo, Bart! Next week, class gives its first recital. And you, you will dance the male lead. Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet? I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet. Yet you feel the boys will laugh at you, no? No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the snot out of me. Hey, Dad. What you doing? Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the want ads to find a part-time job. Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival. No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest s*x machine. I'll never pay off that debt! Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's. That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job! Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa. I didn't turn it on, I thought you did. No. Well, anyway, turn it off. It is off. You have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here for detention. Pretty big crowd. We even bused in troublemakers from other schools. That spiky-haired, masked dancer is really something. I wonder who he is. He's graceful, yet masculine. So it's okay for me to enjoy this. This reminds me of the movie Fame, and to a lesser extent... the TV series, which was also called Fame. Oh, wow, I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend Mel Brooks. I loved that movie Young Frankenstein. Scared the hell out of me. Thanks. Let's do that 2000-pound-man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, and you be what's-his-face. It's not easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner... and the timing that only we... Sir, today, every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems 2000 years ago? Sure! Sure we had. Of course, we was caves. But every cave had a national anthem. I'll never forget my cave's national anthem. What was that national anthem? Let them all go to hell except Cave 76 What's with the si...? What's with the siren? Evening, Simpson. Got a short in your taillight. Started blinking when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license. Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt! Since you're trying to make a getaway in park... I'm guessing you don't have a license. Better head to the DMV. These two broads'll help you out. Wow. Officer, this man is making me a little edgy. Could you give me a ride to the airport? Hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks! Sure, I'll give you a ride. Thank you. On the way we can do that 2000-dollar-man thing. You be Carl Reiner, and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum. Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner, and let me play Police Chief Wiggum. I hate Carl Reiner! I haven't been moved like this since The Joy Luck Club. They love me. I'm accepted. I don 't need this mask anymore. Behold! The masked dancer is me, Bart! It is I who have won your acclaim! Bart does ballet! He dances like girls! Go ahead and laugh. I took a chance and did what I wanted to do. And if that makes me a sissy, well, then, I guess I'm a sissy. He's a sissy! Let's rush him! Yeah! Yeah, let's get him, come on! After him! Go! There he is! There, right there! Bart, use the ballet. Leap! Leap like you've never leapt before! Looks like he took a pretty bad spill. Well, as long as he's hurt. Bart, I am so proud of you. You've shown a sensitive side of yourself... that can never be erased. From this day forward, we are kindred spirits. Why'd she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention? Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV... where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert. Tested, Homer. God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you always fighting. Oh, okay, Marge. I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes. Yes! I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes! Now, that's sarcasm. Well, well, well. Look who needs us again... to get his chauffeur's license. Look, all I ask is that you be fair. Did not adjust side mirror. Minus one point. Failed to check blind spot. Minus two points. You'll be happy when my family thinks I'm a loser. You are a loser, Homer! And we're winners. You gotta learn that. Seat belt twisted. Minus one point. Nagging the driver. Minus 10 points for you! Grazed a cone. Minus five. Being a jerk. Minus a million! One more wrong answer, and Homer flunks another of life's little tests. And what's this? Someone didn't fill in a circle all the way. Oh, boy. Oh, that felt good. Let me try. Let me try. Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, that was so sweet. So, Homer, how'd you do? Well, I... Ladies, please don't tell me you're smoking in a government building. Because that is the kind of infraction... that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion. Well... What? You mean... Why... Oh, you're talking about she... Who's? What? She... What, this? I'll never forgive myself for this. Wait a minute. Those are yours, sir? Yes. I am in flavor country. Both of them? It's a big country. Ladies, I apologize. And you, sir, are worse than Hitler. Homer, I'm... I'm speechless. You just saved our hides. On top of everything else... don't make me picture your hides. It's a wonderful thing you did... for my sisters. I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you. No, Homie. You see? This is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see. Homer. We're... sorry. Lf there's anything we can do... Call off the debt? Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test. Call off the debt? Well... Debt's off! Let's go, Marge!
#06x18 - A Star is Burns^Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and this is Eye on Springfield. Tonight, Springfield's answer to the Benedictine monks: The rapping rabbis. Don 't eat pork Not even with a fork. Can 't touch this. Marge, are we Jewish? No, Homer. But first, we all stink. We all... Hey! According to a survey ranking Springfield as the least popular city in America. In science, dead last. I'm telling you people, the Earth revolves around the sun. Burn him! What a story. You've stolen my soul! In culture, dead last. Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression. So I propose... Oh, that's right. I'm crippled. This is terrible. People will start to avoid Springfield. But what can I do? I'm just... one man. I think we should call a town meeting. If we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists. No tourists? I'll be ruined. Maps to movie stars' homes! Excuse me, are you Drew Barrymore? What? Get out of here. I'm hung-over. Sorry, Miss Barrymore. What? Are there any suggestions for how to attract more tourism? The easiest way to be popular is to leech off the popularity of others. So we propose changing our name from Springfield to Seinfeld. I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides. Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine. Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end. So long, suckers. This is the last time I use an escape plan devised by Milhouse. Sorry, Bart. I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea. Oh, no. Marge is gonna say something. Now, I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system. The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it! The old person's remarks will be stricken. Who said that? But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes. Could we make movies and enter them? Yes. At last, an excuse to wear makeup. All in favor of Marge Simpson's film-festival idea? Film festival! Film festival! You like my idea? Actually, I have several others. Don 't push your luck! Don 't push your luck! And action. Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as Homer in the Shower... and Homer on the Toilet. And now I give you The Eternal Struggle. Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny. Stupid Dockers. Oh, the belt is buckled. Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket... then put it among the reeds, okay? Lights, camera... act-diddily-dotilly-doodilly action Jackson. Help me! Flanders to God Flanders to God. Get off your cloud and save my Todd. Thanks, God. Okely-dokely. What you doing, Ma? Looking for a film critic to judge our festival. Did you know there are over 600 critics on TV... and Leonard Maltin is the best-looking of them all? Welcome to Coming Attractions. I'm your host, Jay Sherman. Thank you. Tonight we review an aging Charles Bronson in Death Wish IX. I wish I was dead. But first we have a special guest, Rainier Wolfcastle... star of the reprehensible McBain movies. Jay, my new film is a mix of action und comedy. It's called McBain: Let's Get Silly. Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? That's the joke. You suck, McBain! Now my Woody Allen impression. I'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls. Hey, that really sucked! The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a half. It cost $80 million. How do you sleep at night? On top of a pile of money with many beautiful ladies. Just asking. I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive. He's not obsessed with his physical appearance. My ears are burning. I wasn't talking about you, Dad. No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-Tip. Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf of the people of Springfield... I would like to invite you to judge our film festival. You can stay with us and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country. Marge, is this a pimple or a boil? Just a minute, Homer. Look what you made me write. Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. Sincerely, Marge Simpson. Do I really wanna leave Manhattan? Sherman, I just realized you insulted me. Now you will die. Hey, nudnik, your shoe's untied. From here, they appear to be tied. But I will go in for a closer look. Taxi. To the airport! On closer inspection, these are Loafers. Attention, the flight from New York has arrived. Hey, I'm landing here. It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours. Oh, you're right. There you... Just a second. Oh, that should... Hello, I'm Marge Simpson, and this is my husband, Homer. Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane. And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil. It was a gummy bear. Coming up next, The Flintstones Meet the Jetsons. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover. Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman the critic. Hello. Hey, man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it. I suddenly feel so dirty. I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped 37 percent. We have a bad image, sir. Research shows people see you as something of an ogre. I ought to club them and eat their bones. Maybe this film festival could help us. A film biography might let them get to know the real you. Virtuous, heroic, nubile. You left out "pleasant." But I like that film-biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power... like Bugsy or Working Girl. Get me Steven Spielberg. He's unavailable. Get his nonunion Mexican equivalent. Listen, Señor Spielbergo... I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler. Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I are like peas in a pod. We're both factory owners. We both made shells for the Nazis. But mine worked, damn it. Now, go out there and win me that festival! Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop. But I'm still hungry. Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer Prizes. Well, it's not like I carry them around with me. It's so hot in here. Oh, look, here's my People's Choice Award. Five Golden Globes... Where's my Emmy? Thank you. Yeah, well, I won... the belching contest at work. Very nice, Homer. Wow, how many Pulitzer Prize winners can do that? Just me and Eudora Welty. I invited my sisters over. Sisters. Allow me. So then I said to Woody Allen, "Well, Camus can do, but Sartre is 'smartre.'" So original. How droll. Yeah, well, Scooby-Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter. Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert. So tell us, who's gay? Oh, I don't know. Harvey Fierstein. No. Who else? MacGyver's gay. You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you? What you doing, Marge? Making the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay. Marge, do you respect my intelligence? Yes. Okay. Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes? No reason. Okay. Wait a minute. Are you humoring me? Yes. Okay. Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy... but does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song? Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener. That is what I'd truly like to be 'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wiener. Everyone would be in love with me. That's it, Marge. He knows the whole hot-dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by. It's just you and me now, lock of hair. You don't have to do this. You think I'm stupid. I don't think you're stupid. Prove it. Put me on that film-jury-festival thing. Fine. You're on the jury. Sir, the actors are here to audition for the part of you. Excellent. Excellent. Next. Excellent. Next. Exactly. Next. Oh, it's hopeless. I'll have to play myself. I thought they were playing The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight. Our first film is by lndian director Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. Bright Lights, Beef Jerky. Help! Help! Police! Hey, I got problems of my own right now. Oh, boy. This is gonna get worse before it gets better. Next, we have Moe the bartender in Moe Better Booze. Money gets you one more round Drink it down, you stupid clown. Money gets you one more round You're out on your ass. My back! Hans Moleman Productions presents... Man Getting Hit by Football. This contest is over. Give that man the $ 10,000! This isn't America 's Funniest Home Videos. But the ball, his groin. It works on so many levels. Roll it again. Next, they're gonna show my movie. You made a movie? I made a movie? No wonder I was on the cover of Entertainment Weekly. My name is Barney Gumble. I'm 40, I'm single, and I drink. There's a line in Othello about a drinker. Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast. That pretty well covers it. It's brilliant. Savagely honest. Tender. He has the soul of a poet. You're very kind. Excuse me. Did something crawl down your throat and die? It didn't die. My name is Barney, and I'm an alcoholic. Mr. Gumble, this is a Girl Scout meeting. Is it? Or is it that you girls can't admit you have a problem? Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead. I think we have a winner. What'd I miss? Homer, please pay attention. There's just one more movie. Simple villagers, I promise you... I will close plants in America and bring work here. We did 20 takes, and that was the best one. Remember, Elliott, I'll be right here. Pure egotism. Self-indulgent tripe. I don't care what they say. I'm going to win this festival. Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur. You truly are the king of kings. Excellent. Smithers, are they booing me? No. They're saying, "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Are you saying, "Boo," or, "Boo-urns"? I was saying, "Boo-urns." All right, it's time to vote for the grand prize. I vote for Barney Gumble's sensitive yet unfortunately titled film, Pukahantas. Second! Well, I vote for Burns' movie. Me too. Now let's get going. I got a date with Eudora Welty. Coming, Eudora! Excellent. Bribing those two judges has paid off. Like the Miss Teen America pageant. How can you vote for Burns' movie? Let's just say it moved me to a bigger house! I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet. Oh, dear. Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you. Football in the Groin! Football in the Groin! We're not gonna resolve this deadlock anytime soon. Why don't we all take a five-minute break. It'll clear our heads. Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute. I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury... and you vote for the stupidest film. I have a right to be on that jury... even though I'm sleeping with the head of the festival. How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that? Great. Now you're gonna make fun of me. No, Homer. I won't make fun. But I will suggest there may be better things in life... than seeing a man get hit in the groin with a football. Well, Homer? Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do. Barney's movie had heart. But Football in the Groin had a football in the groin. Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead. Wow, I'll never drink another beer. Beer here. I'll take 10. And now to announce the winners. The award for outstanding animated short goes to... Itchy and Scratchy for their film Four Funerals and a Wedding. And now the winner of the grand prize. Barney Gumble! What? Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury. You know something, Marge? It's not that tough being a film cricket. I've learned I have a gift to share with the world. From now on, there'll be a new Barnard Gumble. Hardworking, clean and sober. Congratulations, Barney. And enjoy your grand prize... a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. Just hook it to my veins! Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call. And if you ever want to visit my show... We're not gonna be doing that. I hope you tell your New York friends... that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think. Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside... but the suckers will think it's beer nuts. Beer nuts. Well, it was a lovely festival. The best movie won... and Mr. Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought. And the Oscar goes to... I've got to win this one. I bribed everyone in Hollywood. ...George C. Scott in Man Getting Hit by Football. My groin.
#06x19 - Lisa's Wedding^Zounds! I did thee mightily smitely. "Zounds" is a Renaissance English word, short for "God's wounds"... but "smitely," that's pure Flanders. Please call a doctor. These Renaissance fairs are so boring. Oh, really? Did you see the loom? I took loom in high school. Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze. Can I have some? Mine ears are open to the pleas... of those who speak ye old English. Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I might sup... upon suckling pig this noon. Whatever. I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man. I'll go to the first-aid tent and tell them to plug in ye old stomach pump. Alight your gaze on yonder fabled beasts of yore. Behold the rarest of the rare... the mythological two-headed hound, born with only one head. And here, out of the mists of history, the legendary esquilax: A horse with the head of a rabbit and the body of a rabbit. It's galloping away. Here, bunny-bunny. Here, bunny. Here, "esquilax." I've been waiting for you, Lisa. How did you know my name? Your nametag. Would you like to know your future? Sorry, I don't believe in fortunetelling. I should go. What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie and Marge are at the joust. And Homer is heckling the puppet show. Wow, you can see into the present. Now we'll see what the future holds. The death card? No, that's good. It means transition, change. That's cute. The happy squirrel. That's bad? Possibly. The cards are vague and mysterious. They seem to be revealing the story of your first love. Do you want me to continue? Guess so. It's... It's coming to me. Yes. I see an eastern university in the year 2010. The world has become a very different place. I can't wait to see that play. Hey, watch it. Watch it. That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met. A soy-based snack will calm me down. Him again. Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh by Thompson. The last copy was just signed out by... Hugh Parkfield. Oh, there he is. No. It couldn't be. Thanks for holding my book while I tied my shoe. That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too. I read faster. I read at a 78th-grade level. Right here. Finished this page? Ages ago. I'll get the dictionary. Why? You'll see. "Stochastic." Pertaining to a process... involving a randomly determined sequence of observations. First, they hate each other. All of a sudden, they love each other. Oh, it doesn't make any sense to me. Of course not. You're a robot. I never met anyone who so understood the magic of Jim Carrey. He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs. I can't believe how much we have in common. We're studying the environment, we're utterly humorless about vegetarianism. And we both love the Rolling Stones. Yes. Not for their music but for their tireless efforts... to preserve historic buildings. Lisa, I can't bear being apart all summer. Come with me to Parkfield Manor. I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house? Yes, we can, Lisa. That is good. Because eating animals is wrong. So very wrong. When will the world learn? I don't know. I just don't know. I love these new planes. Yes. It's a good thing they re-evaluated those wacky old designs. Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield. Thank you. They were made for the finest family in Britain. I don't know how we ended up with them. Should I laugh? Was that dry British wit or subtle self-pity? They're staring at me. Better respond. It's good to hear a boisterous American laugh. And I love that painting. Judging by the clothes, I'd say 17th century. Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred. I get me brain medicines from the National Health. This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here. I wanted this to be perfect for you. I know you Americans like everything to be... fireworks. Oh, blast. Go to plan B. Yes, I will. Isn't it wonderful? Master Hugh has found a true love. Hi, Mom. Lisa. Hello. How are you doing in England? Remember, an elevator is a "lift"... a mile is called a "kilometer," and botulism is "steak-and-kidney pie." Guess what. Hugh and I are getting married. All right! Lisa, that's wonderful. If only your father was still with us. But he left for work a few minutes ago. Remember we'd always plan my dream wedding, and you always promised... to, you know, well, keep Dad from ruining it? Oh, don 't worry, honey. I guarantee your father will behave. Mom, it's a Picturephone. Oh, this? This? Oh, no. I just got a touch of the rheumatiz. Mom, Picturephone. Hi, Mom. Oh, that's great news about Lisa. Well, listen, I better get back to work. They're finally paying me for this. Oh, yeah. Yes, but the international market is my focus. Oh, Marge, that's great news. Hey, hey, there with the personal calls, Simpson. But, Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married. Lisa? My one true love. It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married. I think I'll write your performance evaluation now, Simpson. I gotta call everyone and tell them the good news. What the...? Maggie, I need to use the phone. Will that girl ever shut up? I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Why not have the whole wedding there. We'll do it on a Monday morning. There'll be fewer drunks. Don't take this personally. I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding. "Whereas Homer Simpson..." Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be in the hammock. "Mr. Smithers plus guest." There's only one person I'd wanna bring. Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover the cure... for 17 stab wounds in the back. How we doing, boys? Well, we're up to 15. If you have three Pepsis and drink one, how much more refreshed are you? The redhead in the Chicago school system. Pepsi? Partial credit. We're invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level. It must be Lisa Simpson. Of course, Martin Prince perished in that science-fair explosion. Not quite perished, my lady love. Although some days I wish I had. Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right? No. Look at this license. I'm Mohamed Jafar. Quimby, after this fare, get your indicted ass to the convention center. I cut the ribbon at that convention center. Just a couple more blocks to my house. Darling, don't worry. I'm sure I'll get along with your family. You prepared me for the worst. As long as they're not squatting in a ditch... poking berries up their noses. And if they are? Here they come. Raise the flag. Oh, Lisa. Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. Hospitality. What do you think of that? Dad! Now throw compost on it. Enjoy. Still warm. You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. If the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box. Oh, Hugh, thank you. You've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal. Lisa, I love you so much. I'm willing to go through anything. Are you okay? I'm fine, Lisa. Fortunately, the compost heap broke my fall. Be a dear, run a bath. Homer, Bart, Maggie, company eating rules. Oh, right. Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just the wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. On the side, I promote local tough-man contests. I'm getting out all my aggression till I go to law school. So, Hugh, have you heard all the latest American jokes? Here's a good one. Pull my finger. Yes, we have that one in England too. I said, pull my finger. Mom, we've got my wedding-dress fitting this afternoon. Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come. Maggie, don't talk with your mouth full. Me and Bart will take Hugh out this afternoon. Hugh should take it easy because of his fall. The only thing bruised in that fall was my spine. I'll be delighted. Great. There's only one thing I ask in return. Certainly. Pull my finger. So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh, Hugh? And tonight, the following celebrities have been arrested: Heather Locklear Fortensky remains at large. Remember, if you see any celebrities, consider them dangerous. You know, I rather like this pub. An English boy, eh? You know, we saved your ass in World War II. Well, we saved your ass in World War III. That's true. There's something I want you to have. My dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge. They brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family. But it would mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive. Well, I'd be honored... to wear those things. Hey, watch those virtual darts. I'm trying to play virtual pool. Hey, hey. No fighting in my bar. You know, Fox turned into a hardcore-sex channel so gradually... I didn't even notice. It's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again. Keep it down in there! All right, Dad. I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer and Bart. No, no, honey. We had a fine time. How'd you get that gash? When we hid in the Dumpster... after the fire alarm went off in the pornographic-magazine warehouse. You are so good to put up with all of this. Oh, don't be silly, Lisa. Everything's fine. Really. Now, go to sleep. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. A big, long day. Lisa, I can't believe it's your wedding day already. Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white. I mean, Milhouse. Oh, Milhouse doesn't count. Okay, I've got something old, that's my pearl necklace. Something new is the wedding dress. Something borrowed is this antique brooch from Hugh's mother. Now I just need something blue. Here. Oh, Mom, thanks. Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me wanna get married for a third time. I met a really nice exotic dancer at Hugh's bachelor party. Hugh didn't have a bachelor party. We had one in his honor. I had one in his honor. I went to a strip club. Well, here goes nothing. Mum, Dad... meet Homer Simpson. How do you do? Hey. How are you? Nice to meet you. You know what's great about you English? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice. Yes. Yes. That's not too bad. Hey, Krabappel, get in the way of that bouquet... I'll stuff that sunhat down your neck. Smithers, take me home. I'm not fully defrosted. Nonsense. Just sit down and rest for a moment. There you go. Oh, no. We've got a little situation here. I can't feel anything below my cummerbund. Hi, Dad. You look great, sweetheart. Thanks. Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me. Oh, Dad. No, no. Let me finish. I want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment, and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better... and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter. I don't think anybody could've had a better daughter... Dad, you're babbling. See? You're still helping me. Hey, Dad, did you forget to give those cuff links to Hugh? No. Well? I found them on the nightstand. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry. But you've been going on about these all week. I'm sure he just forgot. Lisa, we're not supposed to see each other before the wedding. It's tradition. What about my family's tradition? Surely you don't want me to wear those in front of my parents and their friends. But you promised my dad you would. I was just humoring him. Actually, he frightens me a bit. I know they look silly... but his feelings will be hurt. Fine. I must say, you were right. This has been quite trying. I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level... on an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch... as cautionary example. Nothing works. When we get back to England, we won't have to deal with them. You saying we won't see my family again? Your mother will come when the children are born. I can't believe I'm hearing this. I don't wanna cut my family out. Really? Lisa, you're better than this place. You're like a flower that grew out of dirt. That's a horrible thing to say. Oh, come on. You complain more than anyone. Maybe, but I still love them. And I don't think you understand that. And now, to sing "Amazing Grace"... Miss Maggie Simpson. She's quite a hellion, but does have an incredible voice. Stop everything. The wedding has been called off. This is very sad news. It never would've happened if the wedding was in the church with God... instead of out here in the cheap showiness of nature. Who wants cake? The next day, Hugh goes back to England, and you never see him again. Now that I know, isn't there any way to change the future? No. But try to look surprised. You said you'd tell me about my true love. Oh, you'll have a true love. But I specialize in foretelling the relationships... where you get jerked around. Lisa, where were you? You missed the most incredible thing. Hi, Dad. I ate seven pounds of fudge. The man at the stand said it was a record. What else did you do, Dad? I rode the tea cups. Then I got a little sick, and I had to sit down. But then I rode them again.
#06x20 - Two Dozen and One Geryhounds^Welcome to the 6:00 news, in our brand-new studio. Looking good, Springfield. In today's news, a 2-ton rhino escaped from the Springfield Zoo. But zoo officials were quick to act... and Petunia, as she is known, is safely back in captivity. In other news, a 3-ton rhino... that escaped from the zoo last week is still at large. All right, who broke my vase? Who took my tests off the refrigerator and tore them up? Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to? Oh, please. This is senseless destruction... with none of my usual social commentary. If it wasn't you, then who was it? I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now, did they? Did they? I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too... because it's spanking season, and I got a hankering for some spankering. I don't know why you're so energetic today... but prepare to be worn out. What's wrong, boy? Getting tired? I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever. My bongo drums! My strobe light! My Best of Ray Stevens, featuring "The Streak," album. So it was the dog that buried all our stuff. Yes, the dog. Oh, my God! He's got the precious cable-TV cable! Always use fresh macaroni. If the box rattles, throw it away. Your cable TV is experiencing difficulties. Please do not panic. Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones. Do not attempt sexual relations... as years of TV radiation have left your genitals withered and useless. Well, I'll be damned. Excuse me. We're having a problem with our dog. I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone else. I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not me. No. No, our dog is out of control. He's wild, destructive and has little or no respect for authority. Let me try a canine-human mind meld. It's an incredibly rare psychic power possessed only by me... and three other clerks at this store. Okay. I'm bored. I'm restless. Need change in life... like imported leather leash... blue contact lenses... 200-volt-shock training collar. Well, problem solved. Homer, hold on to the wheel! You got it. Hey! Don't worry. We'll catch him or run him over trying. He's headed to the greyhound racing track where we found him. Don't worry, when they find out he doesn't have money... they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know. This place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for him, Homie? Homie? Two bucks to win on number eight. And have you seen my beloved dog? Give me the ticket. We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on. "She's the Fastest." I don't think that means, necessarily... And they're off. She's the Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead. You're lucky you got looks, Marge. Around the far turn, it's She's the Fastest. Followed by Always Comes in Second and I'm Number Three. Yes! Come on, you little horse! And they're in the home stretch. It's... Wait! Another dog is on the track. Santa's Little Helper! The mystery dog... gaining fast on the outside. Of course, he could never win this race. Or could he? What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog? Looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. Come on, boy! You can do it! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end. This is the end of dog racing. I think they're in love. So that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual s*x. Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom? Please? But she's not our dog. She's yours now. Once they fall in love, they lose their racing spirit. Won't you miss her loyalty and companionship? Lady, you're all right. Okay, you can go out and play. But no more you-know-what in front of the house, all right? Hey! What did I just say? Take it. It fell on the floor. Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch? Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team. But he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in. Don't ever say that word again. Well, that's what she is. I looked it up. Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. Feels like a mistake to me. Hey, look. A really small dog just fell out of Santa's girlfriend. Oh, my God! She's having babies! Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat. Look, it's twins! No, it's two sets of twins. Two sets of twins and a triplet. Homer. Homer, find a place for all these little miracles. Oh, my. I've never seen anything like this. How many more can there be? Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-five puppies. An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again. Hey, jerkface. You have the face of a jerk. All right, Simpson, you asked for... Get him, boys. Say, Jimbo... hope I wasn't out of line with that "jerkface" crack. Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable? Yes. We waited many years... but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family. Look at Branford II. Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models lnc. Get that cat out of the way! My socks. Mom, why do I have to wear a flea collar? Oh, it's just easier this way. This time... This house stinks. Are you just putting new newspapers over the old ones? Do you have a better idea? Now, I know we love the puppies very much... but I think they're getting to be a problem. Yeah, they ate all my socks. I have to wear Lisa's to school today. How do you explain the culottes, boy? I have to coordinate, don't I? We've been thinking about giving the puppies away. No! Mainly your mother. Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them? Hello? Is anybody there? All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic... I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight. Splendid. Who's coming? Reverend Lovejoy, your old Army drill sergeant... and the regional director of the IRS. Oh, just lovely, Marge. The whole town will hear what a perfect evening this was. How nothing at all went wrong. Simpson. This evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm gonna forget... that you were mistakenly let out of the Army early. I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening... that there's no need for that audit. A toast to the Simpsons. And to the delectable turkey... that's walking around the table! Dear Lord, it's a demon bird. Simpson! See you at reveille, 0500 tomorrow. See you at the IRS. See you in hell. From heaven. Well, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa. It'd be nice to have some companionship when Mother goes out on dates. We could use a new pet over at the home... seeing how we accidentally killed that smart-mouthed bird. They don't like being broken up. We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of 25 puppies? And I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres... chasing my many cars... drinking from my many toilets. Who wouldn't? Mom, don't give the puppies to him. He'll be mean to them. She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust. I'm sorry, Mr. Burns... but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired? Oh, of course not. They're your pets. You can do as you wish. Good day, everyone. My, he certainly took that well. A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies. There you go. There you go. You too. Honestly, sir, you don't put the effort into your schemes that you used to. Don't worry, folks, we'll find your wallet. Dogs. Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm dusting for prints. We don't have to wait for cops. Who can track them better than their mom and dad? Let's go find your babies. Dinner's on, dogs. I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're ever gonna find your greyhounds. Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the 25 he got last night. Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies. There. Now, wasn't that heavenly? And don't you feel better too? He's giving them a bath. There you are. There you go, little fella. And you. Smithers, look. He's standing up. I've never seen anything so adorable. You know who it reminds me of? Benji? No. Lassie? No, no. A person. You know who I mean. Snoop Doggy Dogg? Bob Barker? David Brenner? No, no. The person who's always standing and walking. Rory Calhoun? That's it! You stay with me. You're the pick of the litter. Maybe we were wrong about Burns on this one. Are you sure you wanna go through with this, sir? You do have a very full wardrobe as it is. Yes. But not completely full. For, you see: Some men hunt for sport. Others hunt for food. The only thing I'm hunting for. Is an outfit that looks good. See my vest See my vest. Made from real gorilla chest. Feel this sweater, there's no better Than authentic lrish setter. See this hat 'Twas my cat. My evening wear, vampire bat. These white slippers Are albino African endangered rhino. Grizzly-bear underwear Turtles ' necks, I've got my share. Beret of poodle On my noodle it shall rest. Try my red-robin suit It comes one breast or two. See my vest See my vest. See my vest. Like my loafers? Former gophers. It was that or skin my chauffeurs. But a greyhound-fur tuxedo Would be best. So let's prepare these dogs. Kill two for matching clogs. See my vest See my vest. Oh, please, won 't you see my vest? I really like the vest. I gathered, yeah. He's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies. Bart. Sorry. You gotta admit, it's catchy. Come on, Smithers. Let's go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for little Monty, of course. We gotta get the dogs out of there. Hush, puppies. We gotta get you out of here. I know. The window. No. What are you doing? Dogs always land on their feet. That's cats. No, it's dogs. I'll prove it. Best two out of three. Bart, look. A laundry chute. Okay, guys. Let's move. Come on, come on. I've got an idea. Sorry, Monty, but you're too big for this ride. Quick, let's get the... Going somewhere? That's impossible. How did you get here first? Oh, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back. But they're ours. You stole them from us. Here's a phone. Call somebody who cares. Give me that. Now, if you'll excuse us, children... the pups have a date with a fashion knife. There. Now you don't know which one's little Monty. If you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll let the other dogs go too. Nice try. Come on, little Monty. Stand up. Come on, stand up. Do your trick. No. Don't. Stay down, Monty. Stay down. Stay down, boy. No. Don't get up. Good boy. Excellent. Now it's simply a matter of bending down... and picking up the one and only... This can't be happening. They're all standing. I can't tell them apart. All right, you win. I'll have to kill them all. No! But they're so wretchedly adorable. Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns. I can't do it. But I can kill you. No, I can't kill you either. Look at you, standing there on your hind legs... like a couple of Rory Calhouns. Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion. I have, I have. I swear, I'll never wear any clothing made from an animal... that can do an amusing trick. Another victory for Montgomery Burns ' champion greyhounds. Twenty-five dogs, 25 world champions... which so far have earned their owner over $ 10 million. I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs is kicking themselves now. Homer! For the love of God, no! Marge, you know that batting this light bulb is the only thing... that cheers me up after giving away those million-dollar greyhounds.
#06x21 - The PTA Disbands^This bus has seen better days. Well, at least it's safer than the old bus. Time to move. The hole's getting bigger. Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again. Shouldn't you get that fixed? Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. If I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak. I think it's causing some of our low test scores. The battlefield is just a half-mile ahead. Begin braking procedure! This Civil War cannon has been fully restored and is in ready-to-fire condition. But it's a good thing we're not firing it... because it happens to be aimed at the main support leg of that lookout tower. People don't realize that these cannons are very sensitive... and the slightest jolt could set them off. Of course, for safety reasons... we don't keep the cannon loaded. It's just common sense. Otto, why don't you get some more gas. Here's the credit card. And a mint for afterwards. Five dollars a child? Last year it was free! New ownership. But we don't have that kind of money. In fact, no school could afford... Here's the admission, plus something for you. See that they get a little extra education. Yes, sir, Principal Valiant! He thinks he's so hot ever since he swept the Princi Awards. Those things are rigged. On May 21, 1864, the men of the 9th Bearded lnfantry... were sunning and fluffing their beards in the sun. Suddenly, enemy troops crested that hill over there. Fort Springfield, we surrender unconditionally! We're sick! We need leeches... and hacksaws to saw off our gangrenous limbs. But the Springfield brigade was too brave to accept their surrender. Come on, boys. Those white flags are no match for our muskets! Charge! And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies... as they prayed for mercy. It's hard to see what's going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers. All right, children. Switch. Hey, they're trying to learn for free! Get them! Use your phony guns as clubs! Run, children. Start the bus, Otto! Start the bus! Damn! I shouldn't have eaten the mint first. Okay, hop on. Wait! Wait! Seymour, because of your penny-pinching... we're coming back from a field trip with the fewest children yet. God bless the man who invented permission slips. I think I got your lunch. I didn't think this was for me. Seymour, the teachers are fed up. You have to put money back into the school. You've cut back on everything. Salaries, supplies, the food. I don't care what you say, I can taste the newspaper. Shredded newspapers add much-needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats. There's very little meat in these gym mats. Our demands are very reasonable. By ignoring them, you're selling out these children's futures. Oh, come on, Edna! We both know these children have no future! Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong. I've never seen them fight like that. I'm worried that all this posturing could lead to a teachers' strike. Strike, eh? My bones are so brittle. But I always drink plenty of "malk"? How do you expect us to teach with these supplies? This pointer's so old, it's worn down to a nub. It still points, doesn't it? Stop that! And look at this. The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools. Well, the kids have to learn about Tek War sooner or later. Go away, Bart. This is not a good time. I saw you two fighting. I'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down. I'm sure you'd really hate that. There's not going to be a strike, Bart. Yeah. Skinner said you wouldn't go through with it. Skinner said that? Well, I had to clean it up a little. But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want. She did? Yeah. She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day. We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative. Now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy. Thank you, sir. You're being totally unfair, and the teachers won't stand for it! Teachers! You don't have the guts to strike! You don't have the guts to take us all on! That's it! Strike! Attention, this is an emergency broadcast. All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total... Hey, give me that! Attention, teachers. We're on strike! Oh, no. Strike? Miss Hoover, are you on...? Go home, children. Hello? Mrs. Pommelhorst? I'd like to get down now. Hey, now that Largo's gone, we can play the forbidden music. I heard that! Bart? Lisa? What are you two doing home so early? Great news, Mom! Horrible news, Mom! The school's on strike! Maybe forever. Overload. Pleasure overload. Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried. Sit up straight. Eyes forward. No talking. Is that gum? Is that gum? Is that gum? Oh, yeah. Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know I don't like you prying and jimmying. Mom! Dad! Great news! The teachers are on... We heard. And we already hired a tutor. Well, looks like we'll be staying late today... to make up for all this dilly-dallying. Awesome. You, at the crane! Spin around real fast! Now, you! Dump 3 tons of sand onto that Porta-Potty. Hey! Can't you tell my voice from a 10-year-old kid's? Ay caramba! Hey, that little boy is playing three games at once. Checkmate. Checkmate. Checkmate. Dang. Lousy teachers, trying to palm off our kids on us. Dad, by striking, they're trying to change management... so they can be happier and more productive. Lisa, if you don't like your job, you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. I've got textbooks. But without state-approved syllabi... and standardized testing, my education can only go so far. Honey, maybe you should relax a little. Relax? I can't relax! Nor can I yield, relent or... Only two synonyms? Oh, my God! I'm losing my perspicacity! Well, it's always in the last place you look. If we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning? Get away from me. Good news, people! I'm happy to announce another union has joined us in a sympathy strike! The Piano Tuners Local 412! Now for Operation Strike-Make-Go-Longer. You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute. Skinner said we'll crack, purple monkey dishwasher. Well, we'll show him! Especially for that "purple monkey dishwasher" remark. Seymour, you are truly incompetent! Well, I hardly think it's fair... Dummy up, you! Listen to those passing motorists who support the teachers. Fifteen-minute recess, Milhouse. The recess assignment is chapters three through seven. Yay! Recess! I found a hive of killer bees. You want to go throw rocks at it? Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome scandal. However, it might be feasible in a fortnight. I can play in two weeks. I just can't believe Stark would stoop to that... and right in the middle of Montana and Dakota's wedding. All this free time. I never thought I'd get sick of Razor Fight II, The Slashening. I probably should stop. My doctor says I have the wrists of an 80-year-old. What do you mean, the bank is out of money? Insolvent? You only have enough cash for the next three customers? Just a second here. No, no. I don't have your money here. It's in Bill's house, and Fred's house. Hey, what the hell you doing with my money in your house, Fred? Grade me! Look at me! Evaluate and rank me! I'm good, good, good and, oh, so smart! Grade me! I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning, I caught her trying to dissect her own raincoat. I know. And this perpetual-motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster. And Bart isn't doing very well either. He needs boundaries and structure. There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome. Hello, Mother dear. That's it! We have to get them back to school. I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here. In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics! All right. I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order. Let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss. Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin. Boo. Oh, "boo" yourself! Our demands are simple. A small cost-of-living increase and better equipment and supplies for your children. Yeah, all right! Give it to them! Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes. Raise taxes? They're too high as they are now. I've had enough. Taxes are bad. It's your children's future. Children's future. Yes, children are important. It'll cost you. Oh, the taxes. They're gonna raise taxes. Come on. All right, that's a good point. Oh, yeah, that sounds... Oh, yeah, the taxes. That means money. The finger thing means the taxes. I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree. I don't agree to that. Neither do I. This is a dilly of a pickle. Oh, my God! The PTA has disbanded! No, no! The PTA has not disbanded. We do have an emergency plan, in case of a prolonged strike, right here. Let's see. "Replace teachers with superintelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood." Talking out of turn, that's a paddling. Looking out the window, that's a paddling. Staring at my sandals, that's a paddling. Paddling the school canoe, you better believe that's a paddling. All right, so the compression and expansion... of the longitudinal waves cause the erratic oscillation... You can see it there. Of the neighboring particles. Yes? What is it? What? What is it? Can I play with it? No, you can't play with it. You won't enjoy it on as many levels as I do. The colors, children. Okay, when I call your name, you say "present" or "here." No, say "present." Anita Bath. All right. Settle down. Anita Bath here? All right, fine. Fine. Maya Buttreeks. Hey, what are you laughing at? What? Oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well, children, I can't help that. Wow, Bart! I'm impressed the way you knocked off all those substitutes. In my weaker moments, I almost pity them. Then I just remind myself, they're trying to teach. I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold? All right. You listen up, you little freaks! The fun stops here. You're gonna shut your stinking traps and behave, damn it! This is one substitute you're not gonna screw with! Marge Simpson. Hello, class. Hi, Bart. Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom. Hi. Hey. Hello! Well, I'm sure some of you already know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother. Mom. Hey, Bart, what about the booby trap? May I? Thank you. Mama's boy! Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet! I meant the other booby trap. Kids have been doing that one since my day. So how was everybody's day at school? Horrifying. Pointless. Exhausting. It took the children 40 minutes to locate Canada on the map. Marge, anyone can miss Canada, all tucked away down there. My teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes. He confiscated everything made of tin. And then he sent us home early... because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener. Oh, okay. Here. Okay. Let's see. What if I did this? You're on your own. There's no way I'll get into an lvy League school now. At this rate, I probably won't even get into Vassar. I've had just about enough of your Vassar-bashing, young lady! Look, Mom. It feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started mopping? I'd be thrilled. You can start right now. And I'm gonna keep teaching your class, like it or lump it. Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawlspace again. I hate it when he gets in there. Over here. Mom, I need a dollar. Since you started teaching, kids have been taking my lunch money. And I need that money for candy. Here you go, precious. Now, go off with your friends. "Here you go, precious." Why isn't my mom stopping this? We've created a diversion. That's a very nice jig, Kearney. Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying? Yeah. That's it. I can't take this anymore, Milhouse. I've got to get the real teachers back. Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions. Wait, that's it. With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts... we can figure out a plan to get them back together. A surprise party for me in Principal Skinner's office? Well, I don't know, but all right. Me? Go to my office? It's highly irregular, but all right. You're not coming out until you reach an agreement. Let us out, Bart! This is not funny, Bart. I mean it. Stop it, Bart! Let us out right now! Don't worry. They'll start negotiating. Bart, open this door! Let us out! For the love of God, let us out! Come on! You are gonna be so sorry. Let us out right now! You're gonna be very, very sorry! Help! Well... Seymour, I guess we could start talking. What's the point? There's no more money... unless you've got some magic new source of revenue. We've got to figure it out. We're locked in here like prisoners. Prisoners in our own school. This was a great way to make extra money... renting out our cloakrooms to the overcrowded prison system. Yo. I used to sit right over there. It's all right, children. Just ignore the murderer. And as a bonus, some of our more troublesome students... might be scared straight. Kid, help me break out of here. I'll totally make it worth your while. I'm listening.
#06x22 - Round Springfield^I'm gonna tell you the story of Krusty's expensive new suit: His sexual-harassment suit. Oh, boy. Anyway, as part of Krusty's plea bargain... he has a new court-ordered sidekick... Ms. No-Means-No. You're hot. Let's get some dinner after the show. I have dinner with all my employees. Right, Sideshow Mel? We've never spoken outside of work. I'm surprised he didn't blame his problems on his Percodan addiction. Wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan. If you ask me, that stuff rots your brain. And now a word from my new sponsor. Percodan?! Oh, crap! Bart, are you ready for your history test? You bet, Mom. Ask me anything. Okay. Who was George Washington Carver? Um... The guy who chopped up George Washington? Really? Wow. Bart, you said you were going to study. Oh! My stomach. You just don't wanna take that test. No, I mean it. It really hurts. Mom, I think he's serious. Kids are so naive. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things. Like when a sign says, "Do not feed the bears"... man, you'd better not feed the bears. Now, get to school, boy. Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test. I have a stomachache. Well, that's a lame excuse for an excuse. Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'll get in a lot of trouble. Read page six of the school charter. "No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies." We're also absolved if Milhouse gets eaten by the school snake. Milhouse: Hey, cool, there's a rabbit in here. Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse? Gosh, maybe you really are in pain. Well, it would be cruel not to let you go. Now you may go. Lunchlady Doris, why are you here? Budget cuts. They've even got Groundskeeper Willie teaching French. Bonjour, you cheese-eating surrender monkeys. Look, my stomach really hurts. All I can give you are these chewable Prozac for kids. Your choice: Manic-Depressive Mouse or the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Superintendent Chalmers, meet our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris. Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that student lying unconscious on the floor? Well, in many cases, the floor is the best... Oh, look, here comes Lumpy, the school snake. Kids: Help! Help! Oh, Lord. Don't worry, son. You'll be fine. This boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst... which will make it easier to find once I get in there. Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog. Homer, this is an operation. Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here! Woo-hoo! Okay, Bart, I will count to three, and you will be sound asleep. One, two, three. Out like a light. Hibbert: Scalpel. Riviera: Oopsie. Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs. Hey, I smell gas. Pleasant gas. Night-night gas. How's my special little guy? How you feeling, big brother? Oh, this is wonderful. You're alive. Bart: No thanks to you, Homer. Why, you little... Now, Homer, please. The boy's just had a very serious operation. Oh, right. Now, Bart, I found the culprit: A jagged, metal cereal O. Wicked. I got this cool scar. And I get to miss a week of school. Dr. Hibbert, can I have my appendix out? Why not. Follow me, kids. Nurse, prep these children. I'm glad you're okay, Bart. Bleeding Gums Murphy. Little Lisa. It's good to see you again. It's been a long time. My friends call me Bleeding Gums. How'd you get a name like that? Let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist? Yeah. Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is. What are you here for? My brother just had his appendix out. Is he gonna be okay? Bart: Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks. I'm doing my rounds, and I'm a little behind. He'll be fine. Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by. You're the first visitor I've had. What about your family? I don't really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times. I've got an older brother that I'll never see. He's a jazz musician or some such. Oh, well. Bye-bye. It must be awful to be all alone in the world. Well, I always had my music. I learned at the feet of Blind Willy Witherspoon. I've been playing jazz for 30 years, and I just can't make a go of it. I want you to have my saxophone. This isn't a saxophone, it's an umbrella. So I've played a umbrella for 30 years? Why didn't anybody tell me? We all thought it was funny. That's not funny. Then I got my big break. I was on Steve Allen's Tonight! show. Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's inspired me to do some improv poetry. Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat How I wonder where you at. I really love the way you cook Like me, when I wrote this book. How to Make Love to Steve Allen. From the author of Happiness ls a Naked Steve Allen... Journey to the Center of Steve Allen and The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen. Murphy: I cut my first and only album, Sax on the Beach. But then I spent all my money on my $ 1500-a-day habit. I'd like another Fabergé egg, please. Sir, don't you think you've had enough? I'll tell you when I've had enough! Lisa: When was the last time you worked? In '86, when I did a guest shot on The Cosby Show. Hey, kids. Meet Grandpa Murphy. But we have three grandpas already. This one is a great jazz musician. They all are. You see, the kids, they listen to the rap music... which gives them the brain damage. With their hipping and the hopping and the bipping and the bopping. So they don't know what the jazz is all about. You see, jazz is like a Jell-O Pudding Pop. No. Actually, it's more like Kodak film. No. Actually, jazz is like the New Coke. It'll be around forever. Wow, you've had some career. Although the moral seems to be that a life of jazz leaves you sad and lonely. Well, before you came to visit, I would have agreed with you. This just in: Krusty the Clown staged a press conference today... to defend himself against charges that his products are unsafe... his theme park is a deathtrap... and that he's marketing videos of Tonya Harding's wedding night. I contend the tourists were decapitated... before they entered the Krustyland House of Knives. Next question. What about that little boy who got appendicitis from eating your cereal? To prove that this metal O is harmless, I will personally eat one. See? There's nothing... Oh, boy! This thing is shredding my insides! Krusty, that wasn 't the metal one. That was a regular Krusty- O. It's poison. So you all set for your recital? I sure am. Look. I stopped brushing my teeth so I can play just like you. Lisa, honey, music comes from what's in your heart, not what's on your teeth. Come on, let's jam. Hey, Moe, what will you give me for an A.A. Chip? Barney, this is a five-minute chip. It's worth a Pabst. Baby, you are gonna knock them dead. Here, take this for luck. Your sax! Thank you so much. Now, I have learned that most of the orchestra... is having their appendixes removed. So without further ado, I give you the remnants... of the Springfield Elementary School orchestra. On saxophone, Lisa Simpson. On triangle, Martin Prince. And with a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum. That's some nice fluting. They'll play "Stars and Stripes Forever." Hopefully not forever. This sucks. Hey, Bleeding Gums, I was great! And I owe it all to... What happened to Mr. Murphy? I'm sorry. He passed away. Oh. Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay? Bleeding Gums was my hero, and I never got to tell him how I felt. Oh, I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy. But he was the only person who had the same love for music that I do. Thank you. Oh, Dad, why did he have to die? Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over. Uh-huh. Remember, honey? Yeah. What I'm saying is, all we have to do... is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman. Oh, Dad! Oh. I blew it again. What? Mmm. Hey, Lis, you still upset about that jazz guy? If it helps, I believe that after you die... you can come back as whatever you want. I'll be a butterfly. How come? Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly. I didn't burn down the school. It was the butterfly, I tell you. The butterfly! He's crazy, boys. Get the Taser. Maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom. Death stalks you at every turn. Grampa. Well, it does. There it is. Death! It's only Maggie. Oh, yeah. You know, at my age, the mind starts playing tricks. So... Death! That's only the cat. Oh. Death! That's Maggie again, Grampa. Oh. Where were we? Death! How come it won't stop hurting? Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies. And Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you. But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them. If you really want to preserve his memory... I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love. "Starland Vocal Band"? They suck! Death! Isn't anybody gonna show up? Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today... to bid farewell to Blood and Guts Murphy... No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy. Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy was quite the sousaphone player... Saxophone! He was a jazz musician. You didn't know him. Nobody knew him. But he was a great man. And I won't rest until all of Springfield... knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy. And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog. Homer, this is a cemetery. Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here! Woo-hoo! What do you do, follow my husband around? Lady, he's putting my kids through college. Good news, Bart. The Krusty-O Cereal Corp... has settled your case for $ 100,000, less, of course, my legal fees. What kind of legal fees? Well, for a case this complex... I had to assemble a crack team of lawyers. Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney. Albert Dershman, who can hold three billiard balls in his mouth. How much of the 100 thou do I get? Five hundred dollars? Yes, well... Cool. Glad you're happy. Let's roll. I can't believe it. Five hundred bucks! Just think what I can do with that money. Five hundred dollars on red. Dealer: The winner is black. Cool. I wanna honor Bleeding Gums' memory, but I don't know where to start. Maybe you could get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him, huh? Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb." Okay, then this: That's the same thing. You replaced "dees" with "do's." D'oh! I have a request. I'd like you to do a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy. I'd love to, little sister, but we don't have his album. What if I could find it? I'd spin it. But ain't no one gonna hear it. Our broadcast range is only 23 feet... which makes us the most powerful jazz station in the entire U.S. Of A. Gee, your station has a lot of problems. Tell me about it. Just look at our morning guy. Hello. This is "Moleman in the Morning." Good Moleman to you. Today, part four of our series of the agonizing pain... in which I live every day. Two hundred and fifty dollars? But I need that album to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy. He's dead? Well, why didn't you say so? Where am I gonna get $500? Now drive, Smithers. Drive. Excuse me, my good man, I have $500 to blow. What have you got? Behold the ultimate Pog. I'll take it. Lisa, look what I've got. Ta-da! Bart, I can't believe it. But why? When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me. Oh, thank you. But $500... You'll never see that much money again. Oh, yeah? Take a look at this. I got the album. Here. You can listen to it on this. I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums. Woman (over police radio): Attention, all units. Attention, all units. Poison- gas cloud heading for... [STATIC ON RADIO] That's nice. Hey, it's getting cloudy. Oh, boy. That was for you, Bleeding Gums. You've made an old jazzman happy, Lisa. You must avenge my death, Kimba. I mean, Simba. Luke, I am your father. This is CNN. Will you guys pipe down? I'm saying goodbye to Lisa. We're sorry. I don't want you to go. Sorry, but I have to. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, what the heck. Once more, from the top. Lisa: One more time! Murphy: Oh, come on, Lisa. I got a date with Billie Holiday.
#06x23 - The Springfield Connection^Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture? They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late? Oh, come on, Homer. There's lasers. You like lasers. Laser effects, mirrored balls... John Williams must be rolling around in his grave. Devil-iciously satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that. We're out of here! Be careful. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types. So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook, and suspect everyone. Three-card monte. Easy money! Homer, these games are fixed. Then how come that guy's winning? I, like, totally won again. Way to go, bro! He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related, or at least in cahoots. Just pick the red card. It's totally not hard. Twenty on this one, my good man. Sorry, dude. Black. Homer, he cheated you! You're giving three-car monte a bad name! Surely you don't blame me? It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid like this! Bye-bye! Somebody stop him! He's getting away! Come on! Come on! No, Marge! I must warn you... sometimes ordinary people get a surge of adrenaline. See? Cuff him, boys. We're putting this dirtbag away. I'll be back on the street in 24 hours. We'll try to make it 12. Marge, are you okay? I think I'm okay. It was scary, but in a weird way it was also kind of exhilarating. Yes. It is exhilarating to see police get their man and save a hysterical woman. Oh, for crying out loud. Easy, now, sweetheart. Homie's here. Hey, Mom. Is this how you caught him? Face it, Lis. You're too puny to... Lisa, unhand your brother. Yeah, like that really hurt. Mom, was catching that guy the most exciting thing you've ever done? Well, it was pretty exciting. But celery soup's pretty exciting too. Strange. Regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. I'm crossing over to deviled ham. Marge! Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new issue of Sponge and Vacuum. Thanks, Benevenstanciano. Death sports. All right, get in there. You're going down. I want a piece of him. You think you're pretty hot, huh? Well, we got everything we need on you. Excuse me. What? What? What? What? What? What? This better be about pizza. Actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer. Welcome aboard. You did what?! I borrowed your nail clipper. What's the big deal? Nothing. I'm just edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop. Cool! Will you bring me along when you do evictions? You got it, little buddy. You being a cop makes you the man. Which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that. Besides occasionally wearing the underwear... which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house. Thanks, honey. All right, you scrawny beanpoles. Becoming a cop is not something that happens overnight. It takes one solid weekend of training to get that badge. Forget about the badge! When do we get the freaking guns?! Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun until you tell me your name. I've had it up to here with your "rules"! Women always have trouble with the wall. They never seem to find the door. You missed the baby. You missed the blind man. Oh. Sorry, Simpson. You'll have to do the course again. I was trying to get this Magic Eye thing to work. Look at that. A pony. Hey, everybody! Mom's home. They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea. Wow, Mom. I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before. Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me. Homie, of course I will. Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to take the bullet? I suppose I would. What about a Coke machine? No. TV? No. TV with a picture of the mayor on it? Whatever you do, we'll be proud of you. Well, thank you, honey. As long as it's constitutional. Homer, give me my pepper spray! Oh, Marge. One squirt and you're south of the border. Incapacitating. All right, settle, people. People, settle. People. Ward and Van Zuylen, stake out Doughnut Land. When they fry up a fresh batch, call it in. Keneally and Earhart, back them up. Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in. And, Simpson... seeing how this is your first day... you're inexperienced and vulnerable... your beat is Junkyville and Bumtown. Hello, Mr. Hutz. I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private. You stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney-dumpster confidentiality. I just wanted to say hello. Hello. You are the new cop on the beat? Okay. I know the drill. What will it be? One hundred? Two hundred? Two hundred. No, no. I mean, nothing. I don't take bribes! Yes, of course you don't. I will just leave this money on the table... with my unseeing back to the money on the table. Apu, no. That's better. That's better. Don 't you think for one minute you can go on... I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address. Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that Mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I said she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe... I noticed, to my horror, that someone... had slashed the pillow. Who called the police? We both did. We both did. Why don 't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow. Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair. But why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong! And I don 't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred. What are you gonna do with your day off? I just want to relax and forget that I'm part... of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos. It's illegal for you to operate that class-9 vehicle without pads and a helmet. But, Mom... It's for your own safety. Take that, safety boy! This padding's so easy on the knuckles, I could punch all day! I just hope they have Us magazine in heaven. He said it was his day to use the tub pillow! I can't go to the library anymore. Everybody stinks. Don't stop talking on account of me. I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend. So how are you, Mrs. Krabappel? Law-abiding. I'm done. Moe, I've never seen you here before. Well, these days, my roots don't stay so chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson. You don't have to call me "officer." I'm not on duty here. Finished. Looks nice. It's a good length for you. Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad. Shush, dear. You'll wreck Daddy's fun. Oh, my Lord! Something horrible has happened! Fooled you, Flanders. Made you think your family was dead! Did you get it? They're not, though. But you thought they were. Yeah. That's why it was so funny. But they're not. That's a good one. And that's the drunk tank, and this is Mommy's desk. Mom, I know your intentions are good. But aren't police a force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elite? Don't you think we should attack social problems... instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons? Look, Lisa! It's McGriff the Crime Dog. Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Hey, great news, guys! I picked up a nudie deck for our game. "The girls of the lnternet." I'd go online with them any day. Hey, hey! We've offended Herman. No, I'm just going out for some fresh air. That guy sure likes his fresh air. None of that for me. Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah, yeah. Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble... now that your wife's a cop? Are you kidding? Being a cop husband is one mighty sweet deal. This police radio entertains me with other people's miseries... we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid... and I can run background checks on whomever I want, Momar. Please, please. Lx-nay on the Omar-may. Hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour. Put that away. Radar guns give you cancer. All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going 100 miles per...? Illegal gambling in my house? Your house? Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated, I thought I was in Vegas. Hey, you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas! We'll be going. We'll just be going. See you around. Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies. I didn't mean to. You've become such a cop. Not that long ago, you were so much more to me. You were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs. I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric... and unplugging the clogs of our legal system. You're cooking what for dinner? Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces. Homer! Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet? Homer, I'm on duty. That's okay. I'm supposed to be working too. You have to move your car. I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there. I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. But you have to move your car now. I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop. That's it! I'm gonna write you a ticket! Come on! We're family! You're breaking the law! I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket and I'll give you back your hat! Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense. What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do, huh? "I'm Officer Marge. I'm gonna arrest you. " Whoa! What? Marge, not here. Hey. You're not really arresting me? You have the right to remain silent. I choose to waive that right. All right, Simpson. You're free to go. Let me just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte. All right, Hans. Time to go. But he ate my last meal. If that's the worst thing that happens to you today, consider yourself lucky. Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail? From this point on, no talking. I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer, but what I did was right. When you need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there. I have nothing more to say to you. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house, à la I Love Lucy. You stay on your side and I'll stay on my side. Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the police academy... I thought it'd be fun and exciting. You know, like that movie Spaceballs. Instead it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie Police Academy. Hey, Homer. I'm worried about the beer supply. After this case, and the other case, there's only one case left! Yeah, yeah! Barney's right! Yeah, let's drink some beer. What about some beer? Yeah, Barney's right. All right, guys. Pipe down. I got some more in the garage. No. I'll get it for you, Homer. I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage. The garage. Hey, fellas! The garage. Well, la-di-da, Mr. Frenchman. Well, what do you call it? A car hole. You're late, Herman. Surely you don't mind waiting... for merchandise of this quality, Mr. Jericho? Looks like good stuff. But, of course, I'll have to sample it first. These are fabulous! Yeah. Who would suspect that they're counterfeit jeans? What better place to make the buy... than in a cop's garage, where no one would suspect a thing? Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny. A counterfeit-jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here. Not so fast. Okay. Maybe you should just stop entirely. Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans. But what about the victims? Hardworking designers like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt or Antoine Bugle Boy? These are the people who saw an overcrowded marketplace... and said, "Me too!" Advance on him, men. I don't think that's a very good idea. Oh, no! It's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge. No, it's Officer Simpson of the police. Herman, your beef is with me! Leave the girl out of this! Okay. Homer! It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen! Is Bart home? Just taking Maggie for a stroll. I guess I am putting up the Halloween decorations a little early. Criticism accepted. Marge! Go, Mom! Bust him! All right, Mom! Go back to bed! Don't make me come up there! Looks like your wife is embarking up the wrong tree. Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house. Oh, Marge, you saved my life. I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you. So long. Gotta catch the 501. He's getting away! You blew it, Marge. I don't think so. Foiled by my own shoddy merchandise! That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago! Marge, how did you know? That the pants would rip? No. What... Years of buying pants for children and a full-seated husband... has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching... which these jeans have in spades. That's nice work, Simpson, but we can't hold him. There's no evidence. There's a garage full of counterfeit jeans. They've mysteriously disappeared. Looking good, boys. That's it. There's too much corruption on this force. I quit. Sorry to lose you, Simpson. I don't think they're coming back. Well, that does it. That does it. I'm looking at his cards. Crap. I fold.
#06x24 - Lemon of Troy^Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe "high voltage." Hello, son. You want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented? No time. Okay. This is for the ages. Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery. Who was Bart? And how did he manage to write his name in solid cement? He must've been smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing. Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology. Ay caramba! What's normal to him amazes us. He will be our new god. Good, somebody's shadow. I'll just turn and brag about my work. Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property. It was an accident. I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart. What would Jebediah Springfield say? He'd be cool with it. Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this? What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood. Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride? It's been going down since the lake caught fire. Now, just a darn minute. This town is a part of who you are. This is a Springfield lsotopes cap. When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield. When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield. When you make lemonade from our trees, you're drinking Springfield. Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield. You have roots in this town, and you ought to show respect. This town is a part of us all. A part of us all. A part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you remember. This town is a part of us all. A part of us all. A part of us all. Wow, that does work. Hey, gonna win some this season? Gonna try. When it comes to catching trout, nothing beats the German light infantry. Beautiful, aren't they? Yep. I'm gonna huck them at cars. Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business? It's clearly booming, Bart. I don't even want any. I just bought a pity glass. We've squozen our whole supply. To the lemon tree! Thar she grows. You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking. This town ain't so bad. Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings. When you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live. Springfield sucks. Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man. Why don't you make me. I don't make trash, I burn it. Then I guess you're a garbage man. I know you are, but what am I? A garbage man. Oh, I know you are, but what am I? A garbage man. I know you are, but what am I? A garbage man. Takes one to know one. Checkmate. Hey, kid. Stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder. We invented that. Copycat. You copied us. Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt... at Nintendo. I just put a rock in your crummy town. That's a crud rock. It belongs in Crudtown. Look at the weak little baby. You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby. Come on, let's get out of here. Hey, they're taking our lemons. We can't spare a single one. You just got citric acid in my eye. You'll pay for that, Springfield. Some things never change. Hey, everybody, an old man's talking. Grampa's the name. Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times? Shut up! It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands... with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan. People, our search is over. On this site, we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely... govern justly and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets. Yes, and marry our cousins. I was... What are you talking about, Shelbyville? Why would we marry our cousins? Because they're so attractive. I thought that was the whole point of this journey. Absolutely not. I tell you... I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins. Well, then we'll form our own town. Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence... and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm? The town of Springfield was born on that day. And to mark that sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree... lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time. Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot. You know what? They're not. I really agree with you on this one, Bart. Class, please. If you don't learn Roman numerals... you'll never know when movies were copyrighted. Come quick. Something's happened. No time to explain. No, children. No. Your education is important. Roman numerals, et cetera. Whatever. I tried. Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened? No. I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that. The lemon tree's gone. And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville. Oh, look, a clue. A candy-bar wrapper. Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville. They love the sweet taste. We gotta get that tree back. You mean going to Shelbyville? We'll never make it out alive. That lemon tree's part of our town and, as kids, the backbone of our economy. We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead. Where are you going, Bart? Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said got through to me. And now, I am going to teach some kids a lesson. I choose to take that literally. Death to Shelbyville! Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, son. Tute on. Hey, Milhouse, get your invasion supplies, and let's go. Get him. Come on. Where did he go? Over here, my friends. Or is it over here? Yeah. Here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick. Nelson's the tough guy. Martin's the smart guy. Todd's the religious guy who ends up going crazy. And now... the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. To step out of childhood and become men. If you get lost, remember... you can always find east by staring directly at the sun. Here's a tip. Put a pinch of sage in your boots... and all day long, a spicy scent is your reward. Oh, my gosh. Look. The fire hydrants here are yellow. This place is starting to freak me out. Danger coming. Behind us. What is it, boy? Is there something behind that wall we should beat up? No time to check it out now. We've got lemonade to sell. Radical. They're getting rich off us. And that kid with the backpack said "radical." I say "radical." That's my thing that I say. I feel like I'm gonna explode here. It's lunchtime. Do you know where your brother's tutoring? Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville. You have a number we can reach him? No, Mom. Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville. Homer, come quick. Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence gang. The trail has become indistinct. I suggest we split up to cover more ground. Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin. Team Discovery Channel. Your wussiness better come in handy. What's going on? I want some answers. Okay, folks, look, I called the police captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids. But if they show up in the morgue, he's gonna fax us. Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks. Honey, I was born in Shelbyville. And it tears me up inside. This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride. But the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness. Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad... it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech. Isn't there anything we can do? Yes, there is. Come on, everybody. Let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves. I got an RV we can use. Flanders'. Yeah! Yeah, let's do it. Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it. Pile in, everybody. No time to wipe your feet. Come on. Okay, piglet, start squealing. Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade? This is Country Time Lemonade Mix. There's never been anything close to a lemon in it. I swear. Hey. Nobody hassles my little brother. Hey. And no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz. Spring forth, burly protector, and save me. Jeez. I never hang out with him, normally. Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear. They remained the best of friends For years and years and years. What are they saying? I'm not sure. I thought you said you could read lips. I assumed I could. It's no use, Milhouse. If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover. What I need is a new face. You leave that to the baron and me. Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians. Wait a minute. If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school? I don't go to school. Okay, what's two plus two? Five. Story checks out. We just got word there's Springfield kids in town. Curse those handsome devils. We're going up to the bluffs to paint "Springfield sucks" in huge letters. That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck. Radical. Quit copying me. You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now. I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs. No, not in my mouth... is what the kid would say. To the bluffs. Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. You know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town. Missing children? Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem. Maybe that's why we beat them at football nearly half the time, huh? Quit stalling, kid. Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters. His can control is excellent. Yes. And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles. That's right, the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson. You know, Bart Simpson. From Springfield? He's from Springfield. Get him! I'll use these spray cans as jetpacks and fly to safety. So long, losers. You're dead. Hey, look. Someone's attractive cousin. Where? Where? I don't see anybody. So he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh? Launch me, boys. Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing cube-gleamers. "Wet cement." I could sure use that flying motorcycle now. You had your chance. Safe at last. "Caution: Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers." Roman numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school. Milhouse, what's seven in Roman numerals? I'll tell you, but you really should end each transmission with the word "over." Over. Correction: The only thing that's over is that transmission. Is this the untimely end of Milhouse? But Milhouse is my name. But I thought I was the only one. A pain I know all too well. So this is what it feels like when doves cry. Milhouse. Milhouse. Now what do I do? Wait. I got it. I got it. I don't got it. Okay, think, Bart. Where have you seen Roman numerals before? I know. Rocky V. That was the fifth one. So Rocky V plus Rocky II equals Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge! Come back here. It's no use. I'm never gonna find that tree. This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. Wait a minute. There's a lemon behind that rock. The tree! A car impound lot. The impenetrable fortress of suburbia. We'll never get the tree back now. Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't get this far to get found out. Found them! You kids are in big trouble. Running away from home like this. But they stole our lemon tree. I don't care what excuse you've got. Nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech. You're gonna... Lemon tree? That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back, or we'll bust in there and take it. Bust in here and take it? You must stupider than you look. Stupider like a fox! I'm okay. Don't you get it, Springfield? It's over. You lose. Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry. This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower. There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital. Pull in there. Oh, great. Now I'm upside down. Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone. No one in history has ever done anything this clever. I'll get the gate. That's okay, son. I'll take care of him. Faster, son! He's got a taste for meat now. Get out here, son. There's a-doings a-transpiring. Let's shut the gate and seal them in. Gun it, Flanders. It won't start. Something's draining the battery. Sorry. We made it. Eat my shorts, Shelbyville. Eat my shorts. Eat my shorts. Yes, eat all of our shirts. Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you... Shake harder, boy. We did it! Yeah. Yeah. And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield. They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil. And though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee... he could easily afford it. More lemonade, Bart? Absolutely. Say when. There are over 14 parts of the lemon that are... And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville. They had banished the awful lemon tree forever... because it was haunted. Now, let's all celebrate... with a cool glass of turnip juice.
#06x25 - Who Shot Mr. Burns? (1)^Is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn? The school normally doesn't smell so rank. Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms. Poor fellow. Crushed by his own water bottle. Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved grade-four gerbil... Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial. You're lucky you're getting a decent burial. Me own father got thrown in the bog. What in the name of Saint Ephesiocritus...? What reeks? Smells like one of van Houten's. It does not. Miss Hoover, the floor is shaking. Ralph, remember the time you thought the...? Now, before we adjourn, I have one last matter of utmost importance. I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena. And it absolutely, positively, has to be there overnight. Pete Porter. Pass it on. Pasadena. Promptly. Package parcel processing. Perk up. Package of plant profit projection for Pete Porter in Pasadena. Priority? Precisely. Here's your package, Mr. Burns. My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate. Smithers, who is this nincompoop? I've worked here for 10 years and my boss doesn't even know my name. Well, that's gonna change right now. My name is Homer J. Simp... son. Sounded large when I ordered it. I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby traps. My Lord. Such destruction. Superintendent Chalmers. How are you going? Why is it when I heard the word "school" and the word "exploded"... I thought of the word "Skinner"?! Congratulations, gentlemen. Your custodian struck oil. You're standing on top of the richest elementary school in the state. We also found this. Thank you. Superdude. A nonprofit organization with oil? I won't allow it. An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of... Betsy Bleeding-heart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote. Sir, have you had enough exercise for this morning? No. Let's do another 20 miles. Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo. Hello... Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's always screwing up people's names. At the picnic, he thought my son Reynaldo was Rolando. Can you believe it? Superintendent, we made the front page today. What's that say under your hand there? Oh, it's an unrelated article. It's an unrelated article. Within the banner headline. Yes. Now, to redirect our conversation... I have ideas on spending this oil money. Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship. Oh, mercy. Before we draw up the budget... the students and faculty have a few suggestions. I want a crystal bucket for my slop water. And a brand-new filthy blanket. The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the kitchen. I wanna hire a new staff. I'd like to start a jazz program in the music department. We've got a great instructor lined up. Tito Puente! Tito Puente! He's ready to give up the professional mambo circuit... and settle into a nice teaching job. Man, it would be my pleasure. Lisa has told me all your students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is. Let's go now, Mr. Puente. Chocolate microscopes. You know those guitars that are, like, double guitars, you know? More rubber stamps. Principal Skinner, this is your secretary. One last student to see you. That's odd. I don't have a secretary. Or an intercom. But send them in. Ahoy there, dean. I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my fourth-form chums think it would be quite corking... if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern. Mr. Burns... It's naive of you to think I'd mistake this town's... most prominent 104-year-old man for an elementary school student. I want that oil well. I've got a monopoly to maintain. I own the electric company, waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue. That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic. The oil well is not for sale, particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself. I see. Then I'll just have to attack you. I must have that oil. Smithers. Smithers, help me subdue this beast. Sorry, sir. This was all I could find. Take that. And that. Please don't waste those. I'm happy for the school. Sounds like this money is gonna provide new opportunities. Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. Said it was unfeasible. It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd hang out with you. I guess they'd wanna be with their families or something, huh? Oh, I hate my job. What's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name? I have an idea. What? What's your idea? When my father was trying to catch my mother's eye... he sent her a box of candy with his photo. After that, she never forgot him. That's all well and good. But it's not really your idea, is it, now, Marge? That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It will all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition. Sir. What I'm about to say violates every sycophantic urge in my body... but I wish you'd reconsider. This isn't a rival company... it's a school. They won't stand for it. Pishposh. It will be like taking candy from a baby. Say, that sounds like a "larf." Let's try it right now. There's candy right here. Why don't we eat this instead of stealing. Oh, very well. Oh, look. There's a photo in here. Oh, yes. That's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who found my teddy bear Bobo. And there's that Simpson mutt, my former guard dog. And that's Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know. Yes, sir. I remember. Anything left? Only the sour quince log, sir. Dispose of it. And send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era of... unbridled spending where petrodollars fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... till they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well. We got an air hockey table. Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump... for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson. Nerd! There's no pressure. Someone else has tapped this well. Ay caramba! Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid. Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers? Oil ho! Huzzah! Holy Christmas! Your dog's condition has been upgraded from stable to frisky. He's free to go. His leg should be good as new in a few months. In the meantime, he'll have to use the wheel-about. I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it. I almost forgot. Wouldn't want you gnawing on those casts, eh, boy? We've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns' slant-drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first. What about the expensive stuff we wanted? Can we still have it? No. Blast it! To pay for the construction, operation and demolition of the derrick... we have to cut nonessential programs. Music... What?! And maintenance. I'll kill that Mr. Burns! And wound that Mr. Smithers. Out of my way. Oh, no. That's awful, Mr. Puente. What? He owns the nuclear power plant. Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too. Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns? He's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card. "Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie." Dad, this doesn't have your name on it. Kids, would you step outside for a second? Dear Lord. That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard. These fumes aren't as fun as beer. Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous... but where's the inflated sense of self-esteem? Hey, if you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'll have to charge you. Man alive! There are men alive in here. I'm detecting over 20 different toxins in the air. Everybody out. As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed. Damn Burns. Let me just get one thing. Me too. Now, there's the inflated sense of self-esteem. Earthquake! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! Well, sir, you've vanquished all your enemies. The elementary school, local tavern, the old-age home. You must be proud. No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers... with free light, heat and energy. I call this enemy... the sun. Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing: Block it out. Good God! Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical lights and heaters running all day long. But, sir, every plant and tree will die. Owls will deafen us with incessant hooting. The sundial will be useless. I don't want any part of this project. It's unconscionably fiendish. I won't suffer your insubordination. There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying. And you will fall into line. Now! No. No, Monty, I won't. Not until you step back from the brink of insanity. I'll do no such thing. You're fired. Take that, Bowl-a-rama. Take that, convenience mart. Take that, nuclear power pla... Oh, fiddlesticks. I must say, Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even. Burns needs some serious "boostafazoo." Right, Dad? Dad. Homer. Sorry, Grampa. It's just, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted. Well, get used to it, because I'm living here now. I ain't going back to the home until they fish my bed out of that sinkhole. Strained carrots for Maggie. Strained carrots for Grampa. I want a bib too. Smithers, who is that ignoramus? Smithers, who is that lollygagger? Who is that blubber-pot? Who is that bafflewit? Lummox. Puddinghead. Mooncalf. Limpnoodle. Goldbricker. Drizzlepuss... Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Look out! What? Just a minute. Who the devil are you? Homer Simpson. What? What are you talking about? Homer Simpson. Make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. My name is Homer Simpson. Oh, you're a dead man, Burns. Oh, you're dead. You're dead, Burns! Hey, the lamp's running away. That's my dog, man. So long, lamp. Now, stop loafing and help your Grampa unpack. That's my old Smith & Wesson. If you're gonna play with it, be careful. It's loaded. Bart, put that down! Guns are dangerous. And I won't have them in this house. How can you have a house without a gun? What if a bear came through the door? I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it. You should've fired into the air. She would've run off. People, take it easy. We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan to block out our sun. It is time for decisive action. I have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings... who, with some cajoling, will pass it along to him... or at least give him the gist of it. Sir, a lot of people are stroking guns. It has been brought to my attention a number of you are stroking guns. Therefore I'll step aside and open up the floor. Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to a friend. But he fired me. And now I spend my days drinking cheap Scotch and watching Comedy Central. Oh, dear God. It's not that bad. I mean... I never miss Pardon My Zinger. Burns cost me my groundskeeping job at the school. And I'm too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery. Because of him, I lost my room... my things and my buddy's collection of old sunbathing magazines. You b*st*rd. I lost my bar. I lost his bar. He robbed the school of music. He robbed it of financial security. He robbed the school of Tito. He can't remember my name! He's causing us all to yell! Look what he did to my best friend. No, my dog. Those wheels are squeaking a bit. Perhaps I could sell him a little oil. You twisted old monster! I've decided to protect myself... ever since I was attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant. Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye a one-way passage to the boneyard. I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel. I'll see that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal machinations of hell's grim tyrant. Yeah. Oh, you all talk big. But who here has the guts to stop me? Very well. One last question. Have you ever seen the sun set at 3 p. M? Once, when I was sailing around the Arctic... Shut up, you. Take one last look at the sun, Springfield. Hey, hey! I've been in Reno for six weeks. Did I miss anything? What the...? Eternal darkness. Well, that's just great. Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns. Where's a gun-toting lowlife when you need one? Sorry, I was in the can. Perpetual twilight. Bathed in the glow of Burns brand electricity. Hello, lamppost. What you knowing? I've come to watch your power flowing. That's odd. Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind. That's odd. Principal Skinner left his mother behind. That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa? After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way. I feel like celebrating. Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. I think you'd better drop it. I said, drop it! Get your hands off. Where is everybody? Hey, man. Are you okay? Won't... dignify that... with a response. Mr. Burns has been shot. Just a minute. This isn't Mr. Burns at all. It's a mask. Oh, wait, it is Burns. His wrinkly skin looks like a mask. I don't think we'll ever know who did this. Everyone in town's a suspect. Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery. Can you? Yeah, I'll give it a shot. I mean, you know, it's my job, right?
#07x01 - Who Shot Mr. Burns? (2)^Ick, my mouth tastes like an ashtray. Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all. Sir, you weren't shot. It was all a dream. That's right. The year is 1965. And you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit. Now let's burn rubber, baby! Speedway Squad! In color. Wait. That was all a dream. Aw! Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck. And- Oh. Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield... but until now none of them was important. I'm Kent Brockman. At 3:00 p. m. Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns... was shot, following a tense confrontation at town hall. Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to alive. Now let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum. Oh. Oh, hiya, Ken. Uh, right now we are questioning two witnesses... who were in the vicinity at the time. Did you see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got shot? Oh, it's no use. They ain't talkin'. Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us. Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And, Dad, well, you kinda went berserk when he couldn't remember your name. Berserk is right! May I have some iced tea, please? Aren't we forgetting someone, sister suspect? Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program... and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone. Could so. Could not. Could not. Could so. Could so. Kids, kids, kids. As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers. The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers. Oh, I bet he's the one. Yeah, Smingers did it. Case closed. Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse. We don't have an outhouse. My toolshed! Oh, Dad! Oh! Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage? No, no, not me. I know in my heart I- A gun. And it's been recently fired. Wait. I remember leaving the town meeting. I must have run into Mr. Burns outside and- Hey! Mr. Burns. What have I done? Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns's sun-blockin' machine. You wanna come with? Sure. I've had it up to here with these damn rickets. Pull, Duchess, pull! Um, uh, what town did we just crush? Shelbyville. Oh, this guilt is driving me mad. I've got to tell someone. Father, I'm not a Catholic, but- Well, I tried to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade. Anyway, I've got a rather large sin to confess. I'm the one who- who shot Mr. Burns. That's all I needed to hear. Boy, this thing works great. The man became consumed by greed. He'd steal from anyone. This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it. Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby. Say, that sounds like a "larf. " And when he tried to steal our sunlight... he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy. Bah! He was a rank amateur... compared to Dr. Colossus. Ow! Oh! When is my lawyer coming? Uh, Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper. Who are you? Where you going? Oh, do your research, Shutton. Uh, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News. How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder of your boss and mentor? Kent, I- I feel about as low as Madonna... when she found out she missed Tailhook. I'm gonna say ouch for Madonna. Hey, that's my Madonna gag. That guy stole my gag. And you stole it from last Friday's episode of Pardon My Zinger. Stole, made up-what's the difference? Mr. Smithers must have seen that program too. He never misses it. Hmm. At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central. I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual. Ye gods! To the police station, Krusty! I am Melvin Van Horn, and this is my associate, Hershel Krustofski. Hey, hey. Officers, you have arrested an innocent man. Really? Oh, geez. All right, Colossus, you're free to go. But stay away from Death Mountain. But all my stuff is there. I was referring to Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns was shot Friday at 3:00 p. m... the very time that Smithers was at home watching Pardon My Zinger. So, you see, he couldn't have done it. Yes, you're right. I remember now. I- I watched that entire show. In fact, I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time. Oh, I gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out. You better get out of my way, please. Slow down. The sidewalk's for regular walkin', not for fancy walkin'. Get outta my way. I'm in a hurry. You simmer down, I'll let you go. So, instead of wounding an evil old man... I may have killed an innocent old man. That's much worse. About 50,000 volts worse, if you know what I mean. Sizzle! Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it? Uh, hi. Um, could we take a look at your leg? Yeah, it's real spruce. You like it? Thank God. Sir, I- I only hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg. You shot who in the what now? Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. And, you, one question. Do you know who shot Mr. Burns? 'Cause we are really up the creek on this one. And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent... we must now ask ourselves: Who could be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers? I guess it's never the most likely suspect. Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason. Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name. Who the devil are you? It's Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson! Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder. Uh-uh-uh. You never know what you're capable of. I never thought I could shoot down a German plane... but last year I proved myself wrong. Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery... is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament. Maybe I could help solve this. I think you're a little young... to be investigating an attempted murder. Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer? Who wants chocolate ice cream? Me! Me! Me, me! Okay, boys, we've got a clue- the bullet they took out of Burns. Now, let's discuss the, um, "mo-tive." Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it's about money. That's some good thinking, Lou. Oh, thanks, Chief. Hey, I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson. And I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look. Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially. Nightclub owner, Moe Syzslak. His bar was closed because of Burns's negligence. Liquor connoisseur, Barney Gumble. When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support- sucking coins out of the love tester machine. That's a real good way to get sick. Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner. His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well. And grounds tender, Groundskeeper Willie, he lost his job... and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket. Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off? You know, uh, Mr. Samba, Senor Mambo. What was it? Tito Puente? Yeah. Well, he did vow revenge. But I can't see him doing something illegal. He's in show business. He's a celebrity. Let's roll, boys. Revenge? Of course. But why wound his body with bullets... when I could set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo? Listen, if you will, to my revenge. Uno, dos, tres. Wounds won't last long But an insulting song. Burns will always carry with him So I settle my score on the salsa floor. With this vengeful Latin rhythm Burns Con el corazón de perro Senor Burns El diablo con dinero It may not surprise you. But all of us despise you Please die. And fry in hell. You rotten Rich old wretch Adios viejo Oh, olé. Yeah! Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent. Gee, I hope all of the suspects are this much fun. Hmm. Now- Now let- Let me- Let me think. Now I did- I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory... to apply my camouflage makeup. Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake. Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am. Superintendent Chalmers. Oh, my God. So, Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts? Oh, yes. But anything else he tells you is a filthy lie. I'm telling you, I could nay have shot Burns. This is your last warning about that. It's impossible for me to fire a pistol. If you'll check my medical records... you'll see I have a crippling arthritis in me index fingers. Look at 'em! Oh, I got it from Space lnvaders in 1977. Oh, yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game. Video game? Do you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns? No. All right, maybe I did, but I didn't shoot him. Checks out. Okay, sir, you're free to go. Good, 'cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right! I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies... in the Victoria Secret Catalog. Sears Catalog. Now would you unhook this already, please? I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment. Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it? You accuse me of everything around here. "Who put slippers in the dishwasher?" "Who threw a cane at the TV?" "Who fell into the china hutch?" I was just asking if you'd seen it. There's no need to be a prickly pear. Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad. Were you talking to me, Grampa? Um, yes. Eww! We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain-buster. Well, better drink some coffee. We're out of coffee. Well, I'll just drink this warm cream. Huh? I'm not following you. Huh? Look at Burns's suit! Yeesh! What? Oh! Oh. I had an idea, Chief. Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got shot? Did you have the same backwards-talking dream with the flaming cards? I'll drive. Eureka! Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours? No. We need to find out who it belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test. Ooh, ooh, hey, ooh, oh. That takes eight to 10 weeks. Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds. What do you got, the whole town's D.N.A. on file? Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got your D.N.A. Why do you think they keep them in circulation? The scan's finished. Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline. Homer Simpson! Bingo. The gunman has a name-o. Chief! Chief! Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on? I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burns's clothing... and your father was identified by the old man himself. D.N.A. Positive I.D. D.N.A. Positive I.D. Those won't hold up in any court. Run, Dad! Hey, ho! Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat. I swear, I've never seen that gun before. They why are your fingerprints all over it, sir? This bullet matches the one we took out of Burns. Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder. D'oh! Yeah, that's what they all say. They all say, "D'oh." Yeah, we need two cups of coffee... and two orders of bite-sized breakfast pancakes, with extra dipping sauce. Please pull up to the service window, please. The wagon's too tall. Oh, I don't wanna have to get out. I'll just drive up on the curb. Blughh. Almost got it. Drop the food, Chief! Dang fools. Drive-through's not for a-parkin'. Diane, I'm going to take my break now. Hi, everybody! Ho... mer Simp... son. Okay, that was a little strange. Um, tell me, how you feeling today? Homer... Simpson. Homer. D'oh, Simpson. Hmm, that seems to be all you can say. When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged? The police have such a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns said he did it. They have Homer's D.N.A. They have Simpson D.N.A. It could have come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier. No, no, no, when I took your father's name... I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A. Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is... the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. Like those fingerprints. They could have gotten on the gun some other way. Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice-cream cones? Yeah, right. You chose fruit. You live with fruit. D'oh! You- Oh! No. No. No. Eww! Why is this on the floor? And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad. No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart. That's right. We all gotta stick together... if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice. Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files. And now Waylon Smithers, who's been a real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing- has a statement that he would like to make. Waylon. Thank you. As Montgomery Burns's closest friend, I'm certain there is nothing he would want more... than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson. Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture. Dead or alive. Holy cow! Me first! Me first! Homer Simpson? So, you finally learned my name, eh? Homer Simpson. I've got no time for your demented parlor games. You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you. The scene of the crime. There must be something here that can clear Dad. Clue. Clue. That's it. Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease. So, the D.N.A. was right. It must have been- Oh, Dad! Attention, all units. Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital. Be careful when we capture him. We cannot claim the reward unless we have 51% of the carcass. Stop! Don't shoot my dad! He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Homer Simpson. Stop telling them it was me! I'll kill you for saying it was me! Homer Simpson. What is the meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me? D'oh! Say it, Burns! Say I never shot you... before. Shot? By you? I'm afraid not, my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity... nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was- M-Maggie Simpson! With the sun-blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world. So, I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth. I feel like celebrating. Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. Yes. That's the one. Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby. But with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulence. I think you'd better drop it. But the old axiom was misleading. Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult. I said drop it! Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid. But finding only slack-jawed gawkers... I gave up and collapsed on the sundial. Then with your last ounce of strength... you pointed to "W" and "S." Or, from your point of view, "M" and "S." Maggie Simpson. What? No! With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers. Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've recovered... and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk, I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you. I'm afraid that's insufficient. Officer, arrest the baby. Yeah, right, Pops. No jury in the world's gonna convict a baby. Hmm, maybe Texas. Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident. 
#07x02 - Radioactive Man^Oh, all these new superheroes suck. None of them could hold a candle to Radioactive Man. The only decent new one is Radiation Dude. He's a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man. Explain. The similarities are subtle, but many. For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase, "Up and Atom!" With "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M, in a delicious pun. Go on. While Radiation Dude has a similar... but lamer catchphrase, "Up and let's go!" So you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh? Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man. Yeah, and we both have a special, limited-edition issue... where he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page. I suppose you know then, that Hollywood is planning... a feature film about Radioactive Man. I have got to do something... about that air conditioner suction. Who's gonna play Radioactive Man? I will tell you in exactly seven minutes. Okay. Here we are. Alt dot nerd dot obsessive. Need know star R.M. pic. Yeah, I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star. I think we should bring back Dirk Richter. Kids will want to see the original Radioactive Man. I keep telling you, he's 73 years old and he's dead. Granted, but- Besides, we want to stay as far away from... the campy '70s version as possible. Billowing backpacks, Radioactive Man! It's the worst villain of them all! The Scoutmaster! I see him, Fallout Boy. Go get 'em, Scouts. Don't be afraid to use your nails, boys! So, where can we shoot this picture? We need a city that has a nuclear reactor and a gorge... and can guarantee us the full cooperation of city officials. I'll check Variety. Wow. Look at that ad. All right, this place must be hot. They don't need a big ad... or even correct spelling. I agree with that logic. Get me two plane tickets to the state that Springfield is in. Right. We have $30 million to spend. We'll blow up our dams, destroy forests- anything! If there's a species of animal that's causing you problems... nosing around your camera, we'll have it wiped out! Look, we just want to make movies, not kill things. Right. We understand. Students, I have an announcement. One of your favorite comic book heroes, "Radio Man"- Radioactive Man, stupid! Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that. Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film... the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield. And, they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster... to play Fallout Boy. Oh, and the air conditioner will be fixed this afternoon. Look behind you, Radioactive Man! The sun is exploding again! Bart, why are you talking like that? Yeah, and who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men? I'm practicing my Fallout Boy dialogue. If I get his role, I could finally come to terms... with this funny little muddle called Bart. Ev-er-y-one is... talk-ing a-bout... Ra-di-o-ac-tive M-an... y'all. Wow! You mean, you were one of the original Little Rascals? Yeah. Which one were you? The ugly one? Were you the ugly one? No, I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was lookin' into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a face full of soot. Nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons... for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time... but, you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner can write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think. If you were such a big shot, why aren't you still makin' movies? Moe? Moe! Oh, no! My favorite aggie! Oh! Ha? Hmm? Oh. You stole my bit! You-That's my bit, you- Oh, you stole my bit! Cut.! Oh, my God.! He's killed the original Alfalfa! Yeah. Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan, owned by the studio. Oh, I see. Yeah. That makes sense. With wealthy Hollywood people on the way... local merchants can be forgiven for raising their prices a little. Help me, Radioactive Man. Watch out, Radioactive Man! Totally awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's all in the delivery. "Now is the winter of our discontent"- Oh, no! Run! Cool! Yeah. Mom! Don't make me do this! I don't wanna be an actor. Nonsense. You're going to be great. Now take off those glasses, so they can see your beautiful eyes. At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy? Watch out! Next! Ha-ha! Hey, that hurts. No wonder no one came to my birthday party. At last the world is safe... eh, Fallout Boy? What's for lunch tomorrow? Next. Chicken necks? We're never going to find-Wait a minute. That child has the exact qualities we're looking for.! He's perfect.! What is his name? I don't know. He just came along with one of the others. He didn't sign up officially. Oh, forget him then. It wouldn't be fair to the other children who filled out their application forms in full. Next! At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy? Watch out, Radioactive Man! Brilliant reading. Again? Watch out, Radioactive Man! Fantastic! One more time! Watch out, Radioactive Man! Congratulations, Bart Simpson. You're our new Fallout Boy.! That's what I'd be saying to you if you weren't an inch too short. Next! I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow, or I won't get that part. Pull, you mighty stallions, pull! Show me no mercy! Oh! Oh, I only grew half an inch. I'm still too short. Growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, Bart. Yeah, that's how fast Grampa's shrinking. Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was. Is there any way I can look taller without actually being taller? Good news, gentlemen. I've grown that extra inch you wanted. Plus several feet more. We found our new Fallout Boy! And he's right over there. Huh? Ladies and gentlemen... meet America's new Fallout Boy! Out of the way. Milhouse, baby! Lionel Hutz, your new agent, bodyguard, unauthorized biographer and drug dealer- uh, keeper-awayer. Leave me alone! Mom! Dad! Make 'em stop! What is all this stuff? Uh, we've heard you've become a star. We decided we better start living in the fast lane. What if I'm not a success? How will you pay for all this? I'm sorry. I can't hear you, son. I'm wearing a Jacuzzi suit. I just missed out... on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. George Burns was right. Show business is a hideous bitch goddess. Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. Someone to tell him he's great. Someone to rub lotion on him. Someone he can hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low. You're right, Lise. I can suck up to him... like the religious people suck up to God! Guess what, kids? They're gonna pay us $50 a day to film some of the movie here. Ah, we'll run that cable through here. Careful, now. Hey. Didn't you direct Unnatural Discretion? Well, yes, I did. Hoo-whee! Whoo! Oh! You know, I never walk out of a movie, but, yuck! I've got an idea, Mr. Simpson. Why don't you get somethin' to eat from our food truck? Hey.! M-Mr. Simpson? You've gotta give me the part of Krispy the Clown! I'm sorry! You're wrong for the part. But look at my range! I'm sorry. Krispy the Clown has been cast. But I will hire you for Angry the Clown, Silly Sailor and Dr. Clownius. I won't let you down! Well, I might let you down on Silly Sailor. Up and atom. Up and at them. Up and atom! Up and at them! Up and atom! Up and at them! Better. Hi, Milhouse! Hey, I want you to know... that I'm glad at least one of us got the part. Milhouse! I didn't do it. I wished him well. I wished him well! Stupid dummy wasn't supposed to explode yet. There's the real Milhouse. Milhouse! Hey, you're not Milhouse. No, I'm just Milhouse when he gets hurt. Ohh! Okay. Let's get the real Milhouse over here, under the X-ray truck. Hi, Bart. Hey, cool, Milhouse. You get to be crushed by a truck. It sounds like more fun than it really is. Hey! I- I think I'm lying on a broken bottle! Beautiful! Use it. Okay. Fallout Boy, origin scene, take one- Action.! Up and at them. Thanks for the help, mysterious stranger. Say. I think those X-rays gave me super powers. And... cut.! That was perfect.! Let's do it again. Uh, these aren't real X-rays, are they? Good question! We'll check into that. Okay. X-ray machine to full power, and... action! Uh, sir, why don't you just use real cows? Cows don't look like cows on film. You gotta use horses. What do you do if you want something that looks like a horse? Uh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together. You guys work on the movie? You're sayin' we're not working? Oh, I always wanted to be a Teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to ya? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, here he comes. What is it now, Quimby? Nothing. Nothing. Only the, uh, city has just passed... another tax on puffy directing pants. But I don't wear puffy pants! I meant a, uh, tax on not wearing puffy pants. Oy! I'm sorry. Wow! You've really got it made now, Milhouse. This is living! Is it, Bart? Is it really? Yeah. Ever since I became a movie star, I've been miserable. I had to get up at 5:00 a. m. just for makeup. I like the way the blush brings out my cheekbones, but it's not worth it. And making movies is so horribly repetitive. I've said "jiminy jillickers" so many times, the words have lost all meaning. We've got to do the jiminy jillickers scene again, Milhouse. But we already did it. It took seven hours, but we did it. It's done. Yes! But we've got to do it from different angles. Again and again! And again and again and again! Yeah! Ach! I can't believe Silly Sailor beat us both up... and imprisoned us in his floating Aquaworld. Jiminy jillickers! There, now, there's no need for profanity, Fallout Boy. Everyone in town has been gouging us silly, but it's worth it. It's all up there on the screen. Yes. That Milhouse is going to be big.! Gabby Hayes big! Okay, listen up, everybody. This is the hardest... most expensive scene in the movie, and we only get one shot at it. So we have to do it right. Fallout Boy will untie Radioactive Man... and pull him to safety... moments before he's hit with a 40-foot wall of sulfuric acid... that will horribly burn everything in its path. Now, that's real acid, so I want to see goggles, people. Real acid? Okay. Roll film! Tip the acid vats.! And... action. Only Fallout Boy can save me now. Where's Fallout Boy? Fallout Boy! Uh-oh. My eyes. The goggles do nothing. Where in the hell is Milhouse? That one shot cost us a million dollars! Where's the producer? I want to talk about this coffee. Milhouse! Thanks to modern editing techniques... we can use existing footage to complete the film without Milhouse. Watch. Looks like we're in trouble, Fallout Boy. Jiminy jillickers, Radioactive Man! We'll have to fight our way out. Are you ready? Yes. Seamless, huh? You're fired. And with good cause! Go! Okay. We can all stop worrying now. These dogs never fail. But... will they just find Milhouse, or will they find him and kill him? Well, they'll- When they find him, they'll, um- Excuse me, you didn't answer me. You just trailed off. Yeah. Yeah, I did kinda... trail off there, didn't I? I know Milhouse. I'll just check all his old haunts. Have you seen Milhouse? No. Now, go away. We're racing... for the title of the Champion of the Universe. All right! Yo! Doctor "S." Have you seen Milhouse today? No. Okay. Thanks. Wait. Did you know that there's a direct correlation... between the decline of Spirograph and the rise in gang activity? Think about it. I will. No, you won't. The only place left is the tree house. Aha! Stay away from me, Bart. I mean it. I'm not going back. I'm not cut out to be a star. But, Milhouse... being a star is every patriotic American's dream. Not mine. It's a sham, Bart. You get up on that movie screen pretending to be a hero, but you're not. The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things. Television? No! Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger. But, Milhouse, they haven't cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of'em! Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones... and to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes. Mickey Rooney.! Hi, Milhouse. The studio sent me to talk to you... being a former child star myself, and... the number-one box office draw from 1939 through 1940! Wow! Spanning two decades. How'd you find us? Uh, they tapped your tree house phone. Milhouse. Listen, you can't quit this movie. I've seen your work. It's good. Very, very good. Van Johnson good. I know I'm good. Movie stardom is just so hollow. Hollow? The only thing in show business that's hollow is the music industry. Come on, Milhouse. You have to do this. If not for yourself, then for the movie-going public... and for the foreign markets that are more important than ever nowadays. And finally, for me... the Mickster. No! All right. I tried. Fortunately, we have a perfectly good Fallout Boy right here. Jiminy jillickers. Jiminy jillickers. Jiminy jillickers! We're shutting down production. Yeah, well, we only have $1,000 left anyway. Ah, there's a $1,000 "leaving town" tax. I hope you're all satisfied. You bankrupted a bunch of naive movie folks. Folks from a Hollywood where values are different. They weren't thinking about the money. They just wanted to tell a story. A story about a radioactive man... and you slick small-towners took 'em for all they were worth. Should we give them some of their money back? No. Hurry, Mr. Rooney. We've got a disenchanted little girl in a Jell-O Pudding commercial. I could play that. So, Milhouse. It must be a little tough... givin' up all that glamour and comin' back to school, huh? Quiet! Maybe I can get my citizenship. We know you don't have any more money left. But that doesn't matter. Just take whatever you need from our boutiques... until you can get back on your feet. Thank God we're back in Hollywood, where people treat each other right. 
#07x03 - Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily^Here's your toast, Maggie. I melba-fied it myself. Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your history project. Wow, Mom, you didn't have to go to this much trouble. It was no trouble. The hoboes at the dump were very helpful. Except one man, who seemed to have mental problems. Good morning. It's class photo day. No Dracula fangs. But they told us to wear 'em. No, they didn't. Huh? And don't put signs on your sister! Now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. That way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry. Huh? Huh? Mom, you fuss over us way too much. Enjoy it now. Because when you're a grown-up you'll have to take care of yourself! Marge! There's a spider near my car keys! You did the right thing by telling me. Shoo.! Get outta here.! That's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a little honey for his Mama Bear. "Good for a three-hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa"? Mineral bath? Facial massage? How did you afford these? Oh, never you mind. What advantages does this motorcar have... over, say, a train? Which I could also afford. Well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms your feet while- Gently massages your buttocks. Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the- No, we shan't. Yoicks! Homie, this is so sweet. But I can't possibly go now. The sink is full of dirty dishes... the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess- Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon. What about Maggie? I got my dad to look after her. Behind ya! Don't do that! Don't do that! Come on, honey. You work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you. Mmm. Well, all right. But I'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car. Tighten those braids, missy. Hoist your flag, Doolie. Nelson, you look adorable. I feel like punchin' myself! Bart, stop scratching. You're messing up your hair. Lice? How on earth does a boy get head lice in this day and age? We bought a wicker basket from Trader Pete's, and he was passed out inside. Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse? So cold. So very, very cold. See ya in hell, you wingless bloodsuckers. What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in "scalpal" hygiene? Well, you'd better check out his sister. She could be rife with them "boogs" too. Keep away! Hey, come on! Those are prescription shoes! I need them! You have cooties! You have cooties! No, I don't! Lisa Simpson, report to the principal's office... for head lice inspection.! Ooh.! Cooties.! Head lice.! Oww! My tongue! Heads up.! Principal Skinner, I need some "sooes." Sweet Georgia Brown! Something is rotten at the Simpson house! Mmm. This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea. Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel. Oh, don't mind-a me. Look. I do it first. Whoa. Would you look at this place? Sink full of dirty dishes. Trash not taken out. Living room a mess. Stacks of old newspapers from 20 years ago. Announcer] Get ready, gamblers, for the World Series of Dog Racing. What the- But I- Hmm. A disheveled and malnourished man found sleeping in his own filth. Seems confused and dehydrated. Where's the baby? Well, that's her, ain't it? Kids love that water. Oh, my lord! Stupid babies need the most attention. All is well. All is well. Turn tape over. All is well. All is well. Children, where are your parents? I don't know. They should be here. Yes, they should be here. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Those parents better have a good excuse. Oh, I love getting away from this dump. It's like I'm on some wonderful drug. What's going on here? Child welfare, ma'am. Here's a little bedtime reading. Mmm. "Squalid hellhole"? "Toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion"? "Dogs mating on dining room table"? What are you doing with my children? We're taking them where you can't get them! What? No! No! You can't! I won't let you! Mrs. Simpson, restrain yourself, or you'll be arrested. Now, just relax, kids. All we're doing is taking you to... a foster home! Yea! Hey-diddly-ho! Welcome to your new home, neglect-a-rinos! Kids, meet your new foster family. We love you! Uh, please don't hug me. It sickens me. I don't judge Homer and Marge. That's for a vengeful God to do. Mm-hmm. All we wanna do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together. You don't understand. Mom and Dad take good care of us. That was a baby tooth. It was loose! Don't you worry, little girl. We'll get you some nice county dentures. "Parents are not to communicate with children... and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times." We leave you the kids for three hours, and the county takes 'em away? Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch! I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me. Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs me the hell out of me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a house plant. Lousy house plant! You son of a- I'll teach you to- D'oh-You- Go with it! Here you go, Todd. The city edition. Bart, I don't know if this should be an extra. Is your source on this reliable? Oh, I hate this place! Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy, Pat Boone-ish quality to it. Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese! Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you wanna do. Watch Itchy & Scratchy.! Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch My Three Sons, but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime. The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Aww! Why? Why? My only son. Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of kitty's ears? Uh, uh, that's, uh, just raspberry jam. Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing like the mouse did? No, son. No, sirree, Bob. Can you see them? I can see Lisa. But it might be a starfish. Yeesh! I gotta call 'em! The number you have dialed... can no longer be reached from this phone... you... negligent... monster. Ohh! That's it! We're going downtown to get our kids back right now! We've always tried to be good parents. Please, I'm begging you, one mother to another. You must have a family. No, I don't care for children. Now, wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Uh- W- W-Well, wait- Wait. Can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day. I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa. And, uh, Margaret? Who? Lady, you got the wrong file. It's Maggie. Oh, Maggie. I got nothin' against Maggie. I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children... you'll have to complete a course called family skills. It teaches parents to listen to their- Communication. Gotcha. But it's important to- Listen! Yes, I know! But there's more to it than- I have listening skills! Mr. Simpson, would you please- Shut up, Judge! Peek-a-boo.! I see you.! Peek-a-boo! I see you! I never heard Maggie laugh like that before. Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention? When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her. I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here. I know! They put honey on our pancakes instead of maple syrup. And they read Newsweek instead of nothing! Come on, you gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl on nonfat ice milk? I want wintergreen. Unflavored for me. And then I saw my boy in a burlap sack... and they told me he had lice. Is this story going somewhere? Easy there, Flub. We're all gonna get a chance. Mrs. Skinner, why are you here? The county is threatening to take my Seymour away. Oh, we had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow. I kept screeching and screeching at him, but- All right, very good. Who knows how the Skinners could have resolved this problem? Without resorting to violence. Or childish name-calling. Anybody? Okay. That's okay. Because making a happy home isn't like flipping on a light switch. Duh, light switch? There are tricks to it, things you should have learned a long time ago... such as, if you leave milk out, it can go sour. Put it in the refrigerator, or, failing that, a cool, wet sack. And put your garbage in a garbage can, people. I can't stress that enough. Don't just throw it out the window. This is so humiliating. Garbage in garbage can. Hmm. Makes sense. Nighty-night, my sweet little foundling-a-dings. But it's only 7:00. Yeah! The sun is still out! Ohh! They say your folks can't pay the rent. So we're watching you by act of government. Well, I don't know if the allegations are true. But you got us and, baby, we got you. Babe. We got you, babe. You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us. I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad. Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days? Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips? They're ten feet away, and we can't even talk to them. I wish I could tell them how much I miss them. It's so quiet here without the kids. What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes. Saxo-mo-phone. Saxo-mo-phone. Ohh. I miss the way Bart would say something and then say, "Dude." I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now. You mean Maggie? That's it. I've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take. That's Bart's ring! "Todd Smells." Oh, I already knew that. Look at the other side. Mmm. Ohh. Okay, let's see if we've learned anything. I want you two to simulate a typical household problem. Go. Uh, Pa, I cut myself on the screen door again. Why, you cotton-pickin'- Hey! No. I gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and the feudin'. I love you, Pa! I love you, Cletis! Well, children, it's Saturday night, so... what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment- Yea! of Bible Questions! Yea! Which version shall it be? St. James! The Vulgate of St. Jerome.! Vulgate it is. Ohh. Okay, for one gold star, what Persian king exempted the Levites from taxation? Artaxerxes! Righty-o! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Well? I know! No, son, we gotta let Bart and Lisa get one. Come on. This one's easy. We give up. Well, guess! Book of Revelations. Fire-breathing lion's head. Tail made out of snakes. Who else is it gonna be? Jesus? Je- Je- Ohh! Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Reheboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Bethchedruharazzeb? That's the kind of thing you should start learning at baptism. Um- actually, you see- we were never baptized. Oh! Neddie? Neddie! Huh? Neddie! No, that ain't gonna do it. I'm very proud of you people. You've learned how to care for your children, how to maintain your homes... and you've all passed the drug test. Except for Marge. Marge, you tested positive for crack and P.C.P. Oh, my! Okay, the retest says you're clean. Sorry about the mistake. The only thing I'm high on is love- love for my son and daughters. Yes, a little L.S.D. is all I need. All right. Sounds very good. Jeepers H. Crackers! I'd better call the reverend. Ned Flanders is on the phone. Hello, Ned. Reverend! Emergency! I-You see, the Simpson kids- Eedelee- I- B-Baptism- Oodelee- Th- Doodly-diddly! Ned. Have you thought about one of the other major religions? They're all pretty much the same. Damn Flanders. Looks like I'm gonna have to baptize you myself. Kids! We're good parents now! Get your asses out here! We missed you so much! He's going to baptize our children? Oh, no. In the eyes of God, they'll be Flanderseseseses. Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hell-bound family. Just sit back, and before you know it... you'll be part of the Flanders flock. You're gonna be Lisa Flanders. You're gonna be Bart Flanders. Aaah! Oh, relax, Bart. Your sister Maggie isn't scared. That's because she can't talk. Daddily-doodily. Where are we going? Where are we going? Okay, okay. Don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders. I'm a big, four-eyed lame-o... and I wear the same stupid sweater every day, and- The Springfield River! I once was lost. But now am found. Was blind, but now I See-e-e-e. Today we write a new page in the Flanders family Bible. Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces? Easy. Easy! Oh, why do you hate my trains? Ooh- Son of a- Eee- Ohh- Ooh! Do you reject Satan and all his empty promises? No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Mmm! Wow, Dad! You took a baptismal for me. How do you feel? Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo... after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan. Wait.! Homer.! What did you just say? I said, shut your ugly face, Flanders! Oh. Fair enough. Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie. Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again. So, what was it like at the Flanders' house? Yeah, give me all the dirt. Let's see. Dirt. Dirt. Well, there wasn't really much dirt. There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage though. Ol' Painty-can Ned! I always knew he'd keep his old cans of paint.! I always knew he'd keep his old cans of paint.! Yeah.! How do you like that?
#07x04 - Bart Sells His Soul^Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy! Fresh from God's brain to your mouth! And now please rise for our opening hymn... uh, "In the Garden of Eden"... by I. Ron Butterfly. In the garden of Eden, honey. Don't you know that I love you. In the garden of Eden, baby. Don't you know that I'll always be true. Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn? Shh! Shh! Shh! Oh, won't ya come with me. And take my hand. Wait a minute. This sounds like rock and/or roll. And walk this land I know one of you is responsible for this. So repeat after me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to hell... where I will eat naught but burning-hot coals... and drink naught but burning-hot cola. Where fiery demons will punch me in the back... where my soul will be chopped into confetti... and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers... where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds. Bart did it! That Bart right there! Milhouse! Milhouse, you did the right thing. Bart, come with me for punishment. You too, snitchy. I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes... that you have befouled with your popular music. You shank! How could you tell on me? Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever. Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids... like the boogeyman, or Michael Jackson. But every religion says there's a soul, Bart. Why would they lie? What would they have to gain? I don't hear scrubbing! If your soul's real, where is it? It's kinda in here... and when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape. Saying "God bless you" crams it back in... and when you die it squirms out and flies away. Uh-huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean? Oh, it can swim. It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery. How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen, you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul. There's no such thing as a soul! Fine. If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell your soul to me? How much you got? Five bucks. Deal. There you go. One soul. Pleasure doing business with you. Anytime, chum... p. All right, where would you kids like to eat tonight? The Spaghetti Laboratory! Face-Stuffers! Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery. Well, what about this place? Moe's. Aah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a family restaurant. Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table. Daddy, this place... smells like tinkle! Mm-hmm. I think we'll just go to the Texas Cheesecake Depository. Everybody is going to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more. You ain't thinkin' of gettin' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe? Ahh, maybe I am. Ah, but, Moe, the dank- the dank! Yeah, family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place... where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family! I'm not ashamed. Hey, put a coaster under that. Oh, Lisa! There's a little present for you lying in the driveway! Oh, boy! Really? Aaah! No! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me! I wasted five bucks on these. Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks. I sold my soul to Milhouse. What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you. You believe in that junk? Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart... it's the symbol of everything fine inside us. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Poor, gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks. Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years. Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for 4.50. I'll throw in my sense of decency too. It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go! Hey, boy. How ya doin'? Man! What's gotten into you? Geez! You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day. Stupid automatic door. Thank you, door! Some ice cream guy's gonna see that, and it'll blow his mind.! Let me try. Way to breathe, No-Breath. This is getting weird. Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex. Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex. So, come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking. How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok? I like it! Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time. I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker! I like it! Hey, how about Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag? I hate it. Oh, boy! The deep fryer's here. I got it used from the navy. You could flash-fry a buffalo in 40 seconds. Forty seconds? But I want it now! The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Ah! I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing. Hmm. Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul. I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda. I think we should do a test. D'oh! Help! Help! Somebody help me! I'm stuck in a banister! Well? Nope. I don't feel a thing. That's creepy, Bart. I think you really did lose your soul. Good boy! Ow! Ow! Who's doing that? Hmm? Nothing. Ow! Help me! Ow! Why isn't anybody- Ow! helping? Hi. Is Milhouse home? He's playing in the dirt with his army men. Oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe. Cover me, Sarge. I'm going after Bart's soul. If the ayatollah can't have it, no one can! Uh, you know, Milhouse- Ye-e-e-es? Bet you're gettin' tired of that soul, huh? No! Well, suppose someone wanted to buy it from you. Oh. You wanna buy it back, Bart? Sure. No problem. Fifty bucks. What? Who's stupid now, huh? If you like good food, good fun... and a whole lot of crazy crap on the walls... then come on down to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag. At Moe's, we serve good, old-fashioned home cooking... deep-fried to perfection. Now, that's "Moe" like it! So bring the whole family- mom, dad, kids. Uh, no old people. They're not covered by our insurance. It's fun! And remember our guarantee. If I'm not smiling when your check comes, your meal's on me- Uncle Moe! Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun. It's good, good, good, good Good-good-good. Mmm! Sounds good. Mmm! Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's something a little off about your hug. Mom, I need to tell you something. I kind of- Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Let me guess. A mother can always tell. Mm-mmm. Hmm. It's not fear of nuclear war. Mm-mmm. It's not swim test anxiety. It almost feels like you're missing something- something important. Like I don't have a soul? Aw, honey. You're not a monster. My soul's my best friend.! My soul's like a toy that never breaks. I'm master blaster! My soul can take your soul.! Bart sold his soul And that's just swell. Now he's going straight to Hello, operator Give me number nine. No soul, huh? Don't worry. I'm still behind ya. Ha-ha! Ahoy there, friends! Everybody find a first mate! Oh! I choose Martin! Wait. Wait for me! Bart, it's time to end this dream. And don't forget the standard scream. An alligator with sunglasses? Huh! Now I've seen everything. Hiya, folks. Welcome to Uncle Moe's. Aw, look at all the cute little minors. Wow, that's Moe. The guy from the ad! Right this way, Homer. And he knows my name! Street signs indoors? Whatever! Now, Rod, you order anything you want for your big 10-0. Million-dollar birthday fries! Uh-oh! "Moe gets so excited when you order his million-dollar birthday fries... he just has to celebrate." Here you go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat! Please take the fries off my head, kid. The basket is extremely hot. How are the southwestern pizza fingers? Uh, they're, um, "awesomely outrageous." Oh, these look good- "Guilt-Free Steak-fish Fillets." Let me level with you, Marge. That's just our name for bottom-feeding suction eel. You don't want that. Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili. I start with the best part- the neck. And then I add secret hobo spices. Ooh! Très bien.! Yeah. What the hell are you doing, you little freak? Ooh, sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children. It cuts through me like a dentist's drill. But, no, that was funny, you taking away my dignity like that. Ha-ha. I would like to say grace. Lord, have mercy on my soul... and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul, and Maggie's soul. And let every soul in Christendom- Bart! I can't take this anymore! I want my soul, and I want it now! Bart! You didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe-balls! Silence, you fool. It can be ours. Run, boy! Run! Run for your life... boy.! Milhouse. Milhouse, you win. I want this nightmare to end. Leave this place. You are in great danger. Where's Milhouse? The one you call Milhouse... is gone. He went to his grandma's place while we're sprayin' for potato bugs. Oh. When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper? Oh, yeah. You don't forget a thing like that. Oh, God. Here you go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat! Yea! Now do it for Terri! What, it's your birthday too? We're twins. Here you go. Here I am. Eat your fries. Eat 'em. Here's you! Aw, geez. And you got the stink lines and everything? Oh, dude, you did not smile. We eat for free. Come on, Shoshana. Let's roll. Ha-ha! But I sang you the potato stuffings! Come on! I sang you the potato stuffings! Look at the vein on that guy's forehead. He's gonna blow! Unkie Moe? What... is it, sweetheart? My sodie is too cold. My teef hurt. Oh, your "teef" hurt, huh? Your "teef" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' "sodie" too! Oh, my goodness.! Ow! My freakin' ears! Oh, let's go, dear. Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here! Aw, come on, folks, wait. Please come back. Please! I got a new offer. Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak-fish. Okay, okay, Milhouse's grandmother lives on 257 th Street... and I'm on 3rd. Ohh. Well, finally, a little luck. I know you and your wife and every part of you Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to talk some sense into this raving derelict. Ah, what the hell do you want- You still owe me $50- Slow down. Slow down! Alfred Hitchcock stole every idea I ever had! He came into my room and- Who's been stealing your thoughts? Did you ever read The Old Curiosity Shop? They made that with John Gielgud- I have powers that- Hello, Ralph. Aah! Uh, hi, Bart. I know you from school. Yes. A simple proposition, Ralph. How would you like to make a dollar? Uh, I don't know. All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul. I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul. Yours! Hey! What's going on over there? Go on, take it all. Get it all outta here. You know, Moe, you might wanna keep the fire extinguishers. Nah. Too many bad memories. Well, look at the bright side, Moe- you still got us. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that actually makes me feel a little better. Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place, that you were going broke? Moe? Moe? Hey! Moe? You're thinking about all the money you blew, aren't ya? What was it, 50- $60,000? Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning. Moe? What? Let me get a pad. A caller, at this hour? You dial "9-1," then when I say so, dial "1" again. Milhouse, please. Bart, I can't play now. It's 2:00 a. m. Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back. I'll do anything you want. Uh, well- Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul! I've got work tomorrow! I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your soul to the guy at the comic book store. But look- I got some cool pogs. Alf pogs! Remember Alf? He's back, in pog form! You traded my soul for pogs? No! Close that door.! You're letting the heat out.! Shut up, shut up, shut up.! If you are waiting for the Hi and Lois signing... it has been moved to the Springfield Coliseum. Please. You have something of mine on a piece of paper. Oh. So you're Bart Simpson. Since my breakfast burrito is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt. You are too late. I sold your soul last night. Yes, yes. I found a buyer right away for that item. Who? I am not at liberty to divulge the party. But they were most interested in having possession of a little boy's soul. Uh, excuse me. No banging your head on the display case, please. It contains a very rare Mary Worth... in which she has advised a friend to commit suicide, thank you. Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson. I know I never pay too much attention in church... but I could really use some of that good stuff now. I'm... afraid. I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul, and I don't know what they're doing to it. I just want it back. Please? I hope you can hear this. Lisa! You bought this? With the change in my piggy bank. There's no change in your piggy bank. Not in any of the ones you know about. Oh, Lise, thank you. Happy to do it. But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe... that nobody is born with a soul... that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer... like you did last night. Uh-huh. Ha.! It's like punting on the Thames. Stroke. Stroke. Oh!
#07x05 - Lisa the Vegetarian^Are we there yet? No. Are we there yet? No. Are we there yet? No. Where are we going? We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa. It's an amusement park for babies. Oh! Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack. That's the plan. I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from eight to God only knows. Come out. Come out or I'll blow your house in. Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins. What a load of crappy crap crap! Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down. This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house. He blows, all right. He blows big-time. That's it, honey. Get into the spirit. Uh, it was good, but not great. Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. Well, I'm sorry. But it was a 150 degrees in the car. So long, su-Aah! Come on! Eat the can! Come on! You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there. Huh? Oh, my! Out of the way, you.! Ahhh. Oh, you are so cute. Yes, you are. You are. I just love you. See? It was a good idea to come here after all. Attention, families. This is Mother Goose. The following cars have been broken into- Hmm? Allemande left and do-si-diddley-diddley-do. Swing your partner to-and-froodilly-fro. All rightilly-dightilly. Hey, Flanders. Hidilly-ho, neighboreeno! Shut up! Okilly-dokilly. So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me? Oh, gosh, Homer. This is strictly a Flanders affair. I got family here from around the globe. Here's José Flanders. Buenos ding-dong-diddly-días, senor. And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders. Charmed. Eh, a-googilly-doogilly. I can't believe you didn't invite me, after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue! The greatest barbecue this town has ever seen. And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show you. Can I come? Sure. D'oh! This barbecue will be hard, thankless work. But I'm sure you're up to it, Marge. Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting. You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever. Why, thank you, Homie. You might say the extra ingredient is salt. Please, Lisa. I thought you loved me. Loved me. What's wrong, Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops? I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb. Lisa, get ahold of yourself. This is "lamb," not "a lamb." What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me? This one spent two hours in the broiler. Bart, sensible bites.! All right, Lisa. If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make. Chicken breast, rump roast... hot dogs. No, I can't! I can't eat any of them! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey, are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon? No. Ham? No. Pork chops? Dad! Those all come from the same animal! Oh, yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, magical animal. I think Lisa's right, Dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad. Hey, that's my chop! Oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism. Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment. Okay, class, time to dissect our worms. First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye. Um, Miss Hoover? Yes, Ralph? What is it? My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it. Can I have a new one? No, Ralph. There aren't any more. Just try to sleep while the other children are learning. Oh, boy! Sleep! That's where I'm a Viking. Lisa, what did I ever do to you-ou-ou? Why does it talk like a lamb? Uh, Miss Hoover, I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong. Okay, Lisa. I respect your moral objection. Um, excuse me. Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it? Possibly the meat loaf. Well, I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative. Yum. It's rich in bunly goodness. Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work? Uh-oh. Two independent thought alarms in one day. The students are over-stimulated. Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms. I warned ya! Didn't I warn ya? That colored chalk was forged by Lucifer himself! The Itchy and Scratchy Show Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm! I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons... send the message that violence against animals is funny. Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that- Ohh! Look, kids. I just got my party invitations back from the printers. "Come to Homer's BBBQ. The extra 'B' is for BYOBB." What's that extra "B" for? That's a typo. Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat? But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, "Yo, goober! Where's the meat?" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. Mom! I didn't mean to take sides. I just got caught up in the rhythm. Good morning, class. A certain... agitator- For privacy's sake, let's call her Lisa S. No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson- has raised questions about certain school policies. So, in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film. Nothing beats a stroll in cattle country. Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such educational films as Two Minus Three Equals Negative Fun.! And Firecrackers: The Silent Killer. Mr. McClure? Oh, hello, Bobby. Jimmy. I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my stomach. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Jimmy. You just asked a mouthful. It all starts here in the high-density feedlot. Then when the cattle are just right- Mmm! it's time for them to "graduate" from Bovine University. Come on, Jimmy. Let's take a peek at the killing floor. Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy. It's not really a floor. It's more of a steel grating... that allows material to sluice through so it can be collected and exported. Getting hungry, Jimmy? Uh, Mr. McClure, I have a crazy friend... who says it's wrong to eat meat. Is he crazy? No, just ignorant. You see, your crazy friend never heard of the food chain. Just ask this scientician. Uh- He'll tell you that in nature one creature invariably eats another to survive. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about. Wow, Mr. McClure! I was a Grade A moron to ever question eating meat. Yes, you were, Jimmy. Yes, you were. Ow. You're hurting me. They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe. Now as a special treat, courtesy of our friends at the meat council... please help yourselves to this tripe. Stop it.! Stop it.! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda? Apparently, my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food chain. Yeah. Lisa's a Grade A moron. When I grow up, I'm going to Bovine University. Hi, Homer. Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue. Whoa, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg! Yeah. Where can I fill it up? Wait, Dad.! Good news, everyone.! You don't have to eat meat! I made enough gazpacho for all! I don't like gazpacho. What's that anyway? It's tomato soup served ice cold. Go back to Russia. Ah, diagnosis... delicious. I've got the prescription for you, Doctor. Another hot beef injection. Hey, Homer. Bring me another one of them, uh, burgers, would you? I can't quite seem to... stand up under my own power anymore. One whopper for the copper. Another burger, Dad? Here you go! It's bad enough they're all eating meat. They don't have to rub it in my face. Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for. The pig de résistance. Look at his nose. Congratulations, Homer. Your "Q" is a huge success. Hey, a toast to the host who can boast the most roast! Thanks, Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly- Huh? Bart! No! What? Sorry. Force of habit. Lisa! No! Uhh! Ohh! It's just a little dirty. It's still good. It's still good. It's just a little slimy. It's still good. It's still good. It's just a little airborne. It's still good. It's still good. It's gone. I know. You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage... when pigs fly. That's a good one. Hey- Hey- Wh-Wha- Will you be donating that million dollars now, sir? No. I'd still prefer not. Give it up, Dad. Piggy ain't coming back. Lisa, you ruined my barbecue! I demand you apologize this second! I'm never, ever apologizing, because I was standing up for a just cause! And you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room! That's it! Go to your room! Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa... would you please ask her to pass me the syrup? Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa. Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product. You dunking your sausages in that syrup, homeboy? Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning. Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart. Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out. Homer, you're not not talking to me. And, secondly, I heard what you said. Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case. Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to. Bart, go to your room! Why don't you just eat him, Dad? I don't need any serving suggestions from you... you barbecue-wrecking, know-nothing, know-it-all. That's it! I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore! I am out of here! That's it! Go to your room! Look! It's Mrs. Potato Head. She has a head made out of lettuce. I can't believe I used to go out with you. Are you gonna marry a carrot, Lisa? Yes, I'm gonna marry a carrot. She admitted it! She admitted she's gonna marry a carrot! I can't believe it. Your windows. Mmm! The next- The whole world wants me to eat meat! I can't fight it anymore! There! Is everybody happy now? I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs. Tofu? Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever. And only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog. I made the switch and nobody noticed. But why, Apu? Because I'm a vegetarian. Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt? That's cute. Here. Let me show you something, Lisa. Wow! A secret staircase. But what do you do if somebody wants a nonalcoholic beer? You know, it's never come up. Oh, Apu, it's beautiful. Yes. This is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world... or when I want to see drive-in movies for free. I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa. That's why I ran away from home. What? She's leaving home? Wow.! Paul McCartney.! I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda? Right here, Lisa. Whenever we're in Springfield... we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade. We met him in lndia years ago during the Maharishi days. Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle. Sure you were, Apu. You know what, Lisa? Paul and Linda are vegetarians too. In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees. Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is- We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market. You'd be surprised how often you'd find a big hunk of pork in them. Ew! Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights. In fact, if you play "Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards... you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup. When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy... simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese? Ooh, cheese! You don't eat cheese, Apu? No, I don't eat any food that comes from an animal. Oh! Then you must think I'm a monster. Yes, indeed, I do think that. But I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, "Live and Let Live." It was "Live and Let Die." Whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm. I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people, especially my dad. Thanks, you guys. Lisa, before you go, would you like to hear a song? Wow! That'd be great! Okay. Take it, Apu. Lisa. Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am! Hi, Dad. Looking for me? I don't know. Were you looking for me? I don't know. Oh, Lisa. I was looking for you. I wanted to apologize. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault. Actually, Dad, this time I was wrong- Oh. too. While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney. Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know? I still stand by my beliefs. But I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue. I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid. Come on! I'll give you a piggyback ride- Uh, oops! I mean, a veggieback ride home. Come on.
#07x06 - Treehouse of Horror VI^Ah, the Miracle Mile, where value wears a neon sombrero... and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. There it is! The chain that put the "fat" in fat Southern sheriffs.! I want a colossal doughnut, just like the one on the sign. D'oh! Nuts! That's false advertising! Sorry, sir. No refunds. I paid for a colossal doughnut... and I'm gonna get a colossal doughnut. You don't scare us. Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok havejust reported... an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen belt. Scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken. Eggheads. What do they know? Hee-hee-hee! I got your doughnut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it? Homer, where did you get that? Get what? That giant doughnut. Well, I acquired it legally. You can be sure of that. Dude, you're huge! Yeah! Let's party, baby! Hey-hey-hey! Fellas, where you going at this hour? Hey, don't scratch up them heads! Good morning, everybody. Panic is gripping Springfield as giant advertising mascots rampage through the city. Perhaps it's part of some daring new ad campaign. But what new product could justify such carnage? A cleanser? A fat-free fudge cake that doesn't let you down in the flavor department... like so many others- Let me go! No! Stop! No! Whoa! Another acid flashback. Man, I'd hate to be driving a bus right now! Aw, they're not so tough. Chief, that wasn't a monster. That was the captain of the high school basketball team. Uh, yeah, well, he was turning into a monster though. What are you waiting for? Wreck the school. You know you wanna. I agree. Destroy the school. Hmm. Hello? Yes? Oh. If you're looking for that big doughnut of yours, Flanders has it. Just smash open his house. He came to life. Good for him! Help me, Lord.! I told you, Flanders has it! Or Moe. Go kill Moe. Just give him the doughnut! Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror! Well, okay. If it'll end horror. Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time? Sometimes. These monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! And you kids should have jackets on. Hey! What's that in his footprint? Hmm. If your advertising agency created all those giant characters... you must know how to stop them. Well, sir, advertising is a funny thing. If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon it goes away. Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef? Exactly! If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll lose their powers. But people can't help looking at them. They're wrecking the town. You know, maybe a jingle would help. Don't watch the mon- Don't watch the... monsters-s-s-s. Well, it'll sound a lot better coming out of Paul Anka. Hey, Springfield.! Are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? Then take a tip from Mr. Paul Anka! To stop those monsters one, two, three Here's a fresh new way that's trouble-free It's got Paul Anka's guarantee. Guarantee void in Tennessee. Just don't look Just don't look. Just don't look Just don't look. Just don't look Just don't look. It worked! They're all dead! Well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there. Mmm. Sprinkles! Homer, stop looking! Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad. Ohh! Here comes something. Remember the story. We're newlyweds on our way to Earth capital. Oh, shazbatt! Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town! Lock your doors! Bar your windows! Because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family. We'll be right back. Okay, boy. Catch the Frisbee. Good catch, boy. Thanks, Bart. Oh, hard luck. Glad to "rake" your acquaintance. It was only a dream. Bart.! Is that you? Yes! Take out the garbage. And then he raked me across the chest. And the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared! Groundskeeper Willie! Oh, my god! Bart, Groundskeeper Willie was in my nightmare too. But he got me with hedge clippers. He ran his floor buffer over me! Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation. There's no mystery about Willie. Why, he simply disappeared. Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up. Remember, class, the worse you do on this standardized test... the more funding the school gets, so don't knock yourselves out. You have three hours to- Finished! Then put your head down on your desk and sit quietly. Ahh. A duet of pleasures. I am the Wondrous Wizard of Latin! I am a dervish of declension and a conjurer of conjugation... with a million hit points and maximum charisma! Ah-ha! Morire: To die! Morit: He, she, or it dies! Moris: You die! You've mastered a dead tongue! But can you handle a live one? Ha-ha! Wheel him out quietly. It's best the children don't see him. Oh, just get it out of here! Not into the kindergarten! Mom! Dad! Martin died at school today! Ohhh! I don't see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willie. Um, we didn't mention Groundskeeper Willie, Mom. Kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest. It's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave. It all started on the 13th hour of the 13th day... of the 13th month. We were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased. Lousy "Smarch" weather. "Do not touch Willie." Good advice. Huh? Our next budget item, $12 for doorknob repair. Nay! Recharge fire extinguishers. This is a free service of the fire department. Nay! Help! Please help me! Willie, please! Mr. Van Houten has the floor. I, for one, would like to see the cafeteria menus in advance... so parents can adjust their dinner menus accordingly. I don't like the idea of Milhouse having two spaghetti meals in one day. You'll pay for this with your children's blood! Oh, right. How you gonna get 'em? Skeleton power? I'll strike where you cannot protect them- in their dreams! Bart, don't you realize what this means? The next time we fall asleep, we could die. Bah! Welcome to my world. Announcer] On this edition of Asian Market Wrap-up. There's a volcano waiting to erupt in the Pacific Rim. It's nine medium-term, convertible debentures- It's no use, Bart. We can't stay up forever! You're right. The only thing left to do is go into my dream and force Willie into a final showdown. You stay awake. And if it looks like I'm in trouble, wake me up. Okay. But promise you won't be grouchy. Come on, Willie. I know you're out there. The sandbox.! Hey, Lawn Boy.! You missed a spot.! When I'm done with you, they'll have to do a "compost-mortem!" Sinky sand! No! Help! Willie's gone for good. Now I can get back to my normal dreams- me and Krusty winning the Super Bowl. Bart, there's two seconds left. Listen up. It's your basic Statue of Liberty play with one twist. You throw it to me. Knute Rockne called it "the forward pass." Now, the clock's still running, so it's important we start this play as quickly as possible. Oh-ho, boy! Don't dream about me no more, kid. Help! Lisa, help! Bart, you're in trouble! Wake up! Wait a minute. If you're here, then you've fallen asleep too. I'm not asleep. I'm just resting my eye- Uh-oh. Good-bye, Bart. Good-bye, Lise. I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for 15 minutes. You saved us, Maggie! I don't know, Bart. Something tells me Willie's still out there, and that he could come back... any time, in any form, and kill us in ways we can't even imagine! Boo! Here I am. Yah! No! Stop! I left my gun on the seat! Hey! Wait here, please. Aw, geez! Homer, get ready.! Patty and Selma will be here any minute.! Oh, no! Better ride this one out in the closet. Sorry, Dad. This is our spot. Oh, yeah? Well, it's my house, so it's my spot. Nu-uh, because we called it. Did not. Well, we're calling it now. You are? 'Fraid so. Ohh! They got me with their legal mumbo jumbo! Just a second.! Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before. Huh? That's weird. It's like something out of that twilight-y show about that zone. How's it hangin', Marge? Yuck! I'm baking like a meat loaf under this wet wool. Uh, may I take your coat, Aunt Selma? Um, I would also like to take your coat. Have we got a family activity for you! A pillow case full of seashells from our trip to Sulfur Bay. You're gonna help us clean and organize them. And pry out all the dead hermit crabs. Get a screwdriver. I'll take my chances in the mystery wall! Oh, glory of glories! Oh, heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of God's creation! Holy macaroni! Hey, you can just suck 'em out. Hello? Can anybody hear me? Homer, where are you? Uh, I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.! Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again. Just a second. No, it's a place I've never been before. Uh-huh. The shower. Hey.! I don't want to alarm you, Marge... but I seem to be trapped in here. We'd better call Ned. He has a ladder. What's going on here? I'm so bulgy. My stomach sticks way out in front and my- Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack, I'm stumped. It's like he just disappeared into fat air. Hey, shut up! Mmm! Unprocessed fish sticks. Man, this place looks expensive! I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it. Ow! Watch it, coney! Whoops. Do you see a light, Homer? Yes. Move into the light, my son. Ow.! Homer, this is your physician, Doctor Julius Hibbert. Can you tell us what it's like in there? Um, it's like, uh- Did anyone see the movie Tron? No. - No. No. No. - No. No. No. - No. No. No. - No. Yes. Er, um, I mean, no. No. Well, where's my dad? Well, it should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual... who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology... that Homer Simpson has stumbled into... the third dimension. Sorry. Here is an ordinary square. Whoa! Whoa! Slow down, egghead. But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe... along the hypothetical "Z" axis there. This forms... a three-dimensional object known as a cube... or a "Frinkahedron," in honor of its discoverer. Help me.! Are you helping me? Or are you going on and on? Oh, right. And, of course, within we find the doomed individual. Enough of your borax, Poindexter! A man's life is at stake! We need action! Take that, you lousy dimension! Huh? Huh? Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I read that book by that wheelchair guy. I'll save Homer! All I needs is four stout men to work the bellows. No, Pops. It's too risky. For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large- Help.! I don't have much time.! That does it! I'm going in! Bart, no! Cool, man! I'm gonna be sucked into a black hole! I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion! And what's gonna become of me on the other side? I don't know! I'll save you, Dad. I can't get any closer. You'll have to jump! Piece of cake, son. Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Bart, what happened? Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sort of collapsed on itself. But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic. Cra-a-a-ap.! Homie. Be strong, Marge. I'm sure he's gone to a better place. D'oh.! Eew! This is the worst place yet. Oh, my god! Look at the- Ooh! Erotic cakes.
#07x07 - King Size Homer^Come on, Simpson. Open up. We know you're in there. Mmm. That one. Someone's in here. No.! No! No! Oh! Oh, for the love of- Boy. I've never seen a man so desperate to get out of five minutes of calisthenics. One, two, three, four. Up, down, three, four. This new exercise program is great. Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth. Yeah, especially your big fat- Oh, wait. Raise your right hock. Aerate. Raise your left hock. Aerate. I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts. Two! Uh, actually, Homer, that's just one. See, each pushup includes both an up part and a down part. D'oh! Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get outta this? Aw, he's at home on disability. He got injured on the job, and they sent him home with pay. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity. Stupidity, eh? Must hurt self. Must hurt self. D'oh! Hmm. Probably better that didn't hit me. Yes? Hello. May I help you? Uh... could you give me a little push in the opposite direction? Okay. Thank you. Carpal tunnel syndrome? No. Lumber lung? No. Juggler's despair? No. Achy-breaky pelvis? No. Oh! I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy. Hey, wait. "Hyperobesity. "If you weigh more than 300 pounds... you qualify as disabled." You can do it, old boy. Yes, I can! Yes, yes. That's the spirit. If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home? Yuh-huh. That's the deal. No more exercise program. No more traffic. No more blood drives or charity walks. Dad, I know we don't do a lot together... but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of. Dad! I must protest. You're abusing a program... intended to help the unfortunate. I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life, I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body. Have you told Mom about this? No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us. Dad! Yes, sweetheart? Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that. Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, little Miss Smart Guy. My God! That's monstrous. I've never heard of anything so negligen- I'll have no part of it. Can you recommend a doctor who will? Yes. Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr. Nick! Now, there are many options available... for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process... combined with assal horizontology. Of course. You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups... such as the whipped group, the congealed group... and the chocotastic. What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor? Ah, be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon. You could brush your teeth with milk shakes. Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College too? And remember, if you're not sure about something... rub it against a piece of paper. If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain. Bye-bye, everybody! Oh, it's a dream come true, boy. I can- Nay, I must eat everything I've always wanted. Now, come on. Every second I'm out of bed... I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'. Eat around the banana, Dad. It's just empty vitamins. Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work. I don't know. Fish sandwich. Are you sure? Oh! 225? That means I lost weight! Homer. You're, uh, on the towel rack. Whoo-hoo! Four more pounds, and my dream comes true. Working at home. Here's your lemonade, and here's your beer. Oh! You're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break? Anytime I want. Oh. Hey, Flanders. Bad day at the rat races? Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people, and a subway ran over my hat. Hey, Lise. Come look at this. Neat. Homer! Whoa! Hello, honey. Hi. Um, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week? I was going to surprise you, but what the heck. Honey, I'm purposely gaining 61 pounds to get on disability. Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your health or your appearance? Oh. So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow. Oh, please! I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds. But- Beautiful. Good night. Oh.! I got 15 minutes to gain a pound, or I gotta face another day at work. Bad news, Dad. We're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon, and you drank all the soy sauce. I need a miracle. Aw, honey. It looks just like a real doughnut. Dad, it says "Non-Toxic." Well, that's a plus. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it! Uh, Dad. Towel rack. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee-hee! Ho-ho! Oh, my. I'm pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. - What's the name of this gastropod? Simpson, sir. One of your chair-moisteners from Sector 7G. Yes! Simpson! Thank you for your pity. Mom, are you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this? Normally, your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out... as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season- I'm looking for something loose and billowy... something comfortable for my first day of work. Work, huh? Let me guess. Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist. Something with computers. Well, I use a computer. What's the connection? Must be the nonstop sitting and snacking. Well, sir. Many of our clients find pants confining... so we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman. Ponchos, muumuus, capes, jumpsuits... unisheets, muslin body rolls, academic andjudicial robes. I don't wanna look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muumuu. Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute. Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets. Due to a fire at the army testing lab... a bunch of escaped, infected monkeys are roaming the expressway. Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows... 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable. Hee-hee-hee! I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas, brake, honk. Gas, brake, honk. Honk, honk, punch. Gas, gas, gas. 8:58. First time I've ever been early for work- except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers. "To start, press any key." Where's the "Any" key? I see "Esk," "Catarol," and "Pig Up." There doesn't seem to be any "Any" key. Whew! All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab. Oop. No time for that now. The computer's starting. "Check core temperature? Yes/No. " Yes. "Core temperature normal." Hmm. Not too shabby. "Vent radioactive gas?" N-O. "Venting prevents explo-si-on. " Ooh, this is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay, then. Yes. Vent the stupid gas. Aw, no! The corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke. Bart and Lisa have to go to school... while I get to stay home. Nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah. I like school. Why don't you live in it then? I would if I could. Not me, sister. When I grow up, I wanna be a lardo on workmen's comp... just like Dad. I wash myself with a rag on a stick. Whoo-ooh-ooh. Euw! Mom! This whole thing is really creepy. Are you sure you won't talk to Dad? I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency. Maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back. You're right. Hmm. Maybe if I use my least-nagging tone of voice- Homer. Mmm. Homer! Homer? That's it. That's the one. All right. Send him on in. Dad? Yes, honey? Um, Mom just baked a cake. Ooh! Hmm? Homer, we need to have a serious talk. You dragged me all the way from work for that? Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons... of your controversial plan, shall we? I- Con: You're endangering your health. Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant. Con: You're setting a bad example for the children. Pro: I, uh, don't have to go to work. Con: You're running the air conditioner nonstop. It's freezing in here. Pro: Uh- Uh, I love you. Con: I'm finding myself less attracted to you physically. Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of- right here. And nobody's gonna take it away from me. You never had faith in me before, but let me tell you- the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big, fat dynamo! And where's that cake? There's no cake. Oh. "Vent radioactive gas?" Y-E-S. "Sound alertness horn?" Y-E-S. "Decalcify calcium ducts?" Well, give me a "Y." Give me a- Hey. All I have to type is "Y." Hey, Miss Doesn't Find Me Attractive Sexually Anymore. I just tripled my productivity. Good. Good for you. "Y." "Y." So many letters to choose from. I'll pick "Y." "Y." "Y." What the heck are you doin' over there? There! You found the floor. "Y." "Y." "Y." "Y." "Y." "Y." I'm going out. I run errands during the day. Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer? The mail! The mail is here! Ooh! "An urgent plea from Edward James Olmos." "Lisa Simpson, can you afford to miss another issue of the Utne Reader?" Kids. Free sample of fabric softener? Whoo-hoo! Mmm! I can feel three kinds of softness. Dad, what are you doing down there? Washin' my "fat guy" hat, honey. We now return to Search for the Sun. Accordin' to Daddy's will... I inherit the entire plantation. I'll see to it you don't get apricot one. Uh, what's your dad's job again? He's a nuclear-safety technician. What's he doin' with that broom? Uh, what isn't he doing? I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman. Hey! Leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man, and he has real feelings. What are you kids lookin' at? Hey, look. He's tryin' to get up to yell at us. Don't make me close that shade! Hey, Homer. You promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside. Nuts to that. I'm goin' to the movies. Shouldn't you be working? I got someone to cover for me. One for Honk, please. Oh, gee. Uh, just a minute. I have to check with the manager. That overweight guy wants to see the movie. I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs. What are you talking about? What I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage... couldn't possibly fit in our seats. I could sit in the aisle. I'm afraid that would violate the fire code. Hey, fatty.! I got a movie for ya. A Fridge Too Far. Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity. I just came here to see Honk lf You're Horny.! in peace. Sir, if you just quiet down... I'd be happy to treat you to a garbage bag full of popcorn. Oh! This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food. I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes. The overweight individuals in this country... are just as smart and talented and hardworking as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard. All they need is a leader! I'll work harder than ever before... and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined... lazy and irresponsible. What happened to my bird? Oh! Marge? Lisa? Flanders? "Explosion imminent." Oh, my God.! The plant's gonna explode.! Hey, that thing's going caca-cuckoo. Who cares? It's Homer's problem. Wait. I know. Vent gas. "Pressure too high"? Oh! "Tank must be shut down manually"? Aw! Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why, you- Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault. I gotta call the plant and warn 'em. The fingers you have used to dial are too fat. To obtain a special dialing wand... please mash the keypad with your palm now. I'm gonna have to shut it down myself! Fat, don't fail me now.! D'oh.! You gotta slow your car down and let me in because I'm a big fat guy and I can't go anywhere. Because there's gonna be some poison gas. There's gonna be really poison gas. Everybody's gonna be dead, especially me! D'oh! The ice-cream man. You gotta let me in your car and drive me- Take anything you want, man! Take it all! Push out the jive. Bring in the love. I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate everything in the restaurant... and they had to close the restaurant. My dad may have gained a little weight... but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac. Ah! Oh! That's raspberry. Oh. Ice cream! Ice cream! Workers, please. There'll be time for the frozen-pudding wagon later. You still owe me 10 more lroquois twists. Ten, ha-ya-yah. Uh! And nine, ha-ya-yah. Uh! Get away, damn it! Run for your lives! I'll take a rocket bomb! What can I get for 30 cents? Let go! I gotta get to the tank! Heck, I can't decide without the pictures. Six, ha-ya-yah. Oh! Four, ha-ya-yah. Three, ha-ya-yah. Two, ha-ya-yah. Stupid switch! I wish I had my reaching broom. One, ha-ya-yah. Wait a minute. There's probably a- Homer, your bravery and quick thinking... have turned a potential Chernobyl... into a mere Three Mile Island. Bravo. I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day... while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death. And I think it's ironic that, for once, Dad's butt... prevented the release of toxic gas- Bart! We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated. Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there, but- For a while, I feared for my life. Now, Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you... please don't hesitate to ask. Mr. Burns, can you make me thin again? I guarantee it. One. One. One! Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction. Whoo-hoo!
#07x08 - Mother Simpson^Here's your caption, boys. "Local Hero Shuns Spotlight and Pitches in." What an angle! I can't believe I'm spending my Saturday picking up garbage. I mean, half these bottles ain't even mine. Let's have less conversation and more sanitation. Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this? Hey, everybody.! Up here.! Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work. Right away, Mr. Smithers. I'll just walk across these slippery rock- Oh, no! He's going over the falls! Oh, good. He snagged that tree branch. Oh, no! The branch broke off. Oh, good. He can grab onto them pointy rocks. Oh, no. Them rocks broke his arms and legs! Oh, good. Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him. Oh, no. They're biting him and stealing his pants. Good lord.! He'll be sucked into the turbine. Smithers, who was that corpse? Homer Simpson, sir. One of the finest, bravest men ever to grace Sector 7G. I'll cross him off the list. That dummy worked like a charm, Dad. Best 600 bucks I ever spent. Come on, boy. We've earned this Saturday. Now let's make the most of it! Sixty-one. Sixty-two. Sixty-three. Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are. You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. I'm sorry. I-I'm just nervous. I didn't mean any disrespect. What are you talking about? You know. Uh- Homer's passing. Away. Into death. What? That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead. He's right out back in the hammock. Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts. Yes, Marge. I can see him. Hi, everybody! Marge, I'm gonna give you the card of our juvenile counselor. A tombstone? It came with the burial plot. But that's not important. The important thing is Homer is dead. We've been saving for this since your wedding day. Get out of here, you ghouls! Ayayayaya.! Hmm? Uh, excuse me. Sir? I think there's been a mistake. Oh, no. No mistake. Your electricity's in the name of HomerJ. Simpson, deceased. The juice stays off till you get a job or a generator. Oh, and, uh, my deepest sympathies. Homer. That's my name. When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me no. You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out. Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue! What the hell is going on here? Listen here! My name is HomerJ. Simpson! You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. I want you to straighten this out without a lot... of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo jumbo! Okay, Mr. Simpson. I'll just make the change here. And you're all set. I don't like your attitude, you watercooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file anyway? I have a right to read it. You sure do. "Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa"- Aha! See? This thing is all screwed up! Who the heck is Margaret Simpson? Uh, your youngest daughter. "Uh, your youngest daughter." Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive! She died when I was a kid! See that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave! My dad points it out every time we drive by. Mr. Simpson, uh, maybe you should actually go up there. Huh? Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person. "Here lies"- Walt Whitman? Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you, Walt... freakin'... Whitman! Leaves of Grass my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says "Simpson." Oh! Why does my death keep coming back to haunt me? Oh! You awful, awful man! Get out of my son's grave! I hate to rain on your parade, lady. But this is my grave. Hey-Wait a minute! Mom? Homer? I thought you were dead. I thought you were dead. Well, dang blast it! Isn't anybody in this dad-gummed cemetery dead? I didn't want to cause a fuss, but now that you mention it. Oh. Homer, you grew up so handsome. Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies. Oh! Oh, my poor baby. You must've been so upset. But I suppose Abe had his reasons. Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time? Oh, it's a very complicated story. Let's just enjoy this moment. Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment. I'm sorry. That's okay, darling. It wasn't your fault. Hey, everybody! I got a big surprise for you! Presenting... my mother! You're kidding! That's Grandma Simpson? Can you believe it? I thought she was- Hello. This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens. Or Melrose Place. Where have you been, Granny? They freeze you or something? Oh, my! Such clever grandchildren. So full of questions and bright, shiny eyes. I don't know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law. No more living vicariously through my girlfriends. Hey! Since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life... you owe me years of back presents! Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwanzaas, good report cards. Hmm, 75 bucks a pop plus interest and penalties. You owe me... $22,000. I'll Kwanzaa you.! Homer, don't be so hard on little- What is his name? This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them. Oh, yes. Right in the drawers. You remembered. Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom. I saw all your awards, Lisa. They're mighty impressive. Aw, I just keep 'em out to bug Bart. Don't be bashful. When I was your age... kids made fun of me because I read at the ninth-grade level. Me too! Hey, Mom! Look at me! Look at what I can do! I see you, Homer. That's very nice. Although, I hardly consider A Separate Peace the ninth-grade level. Yeah, more like preschool. I hate John Knowles. Me too. Mom, you're not looking! You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you. You didn't dumb it down. You said "rapport." Gotta run! Grandma stuff! Huh? There. Now no one should be able to hear us. What? All right. We don't need the dryer. What? Just shut up and listen! There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house. Yeah, I don't trust her either. I was going through her purse. Look what I found. "Mona Simpson. Mona Stevens. "Martha Stewart. Penelope Olsen. Muddy Mae Suggins?" These are the calling cards of a con artist. Woo-hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back. I never realized how much I missed her. She's nice. But? I just don't think you should get too excited... about the woman who abandoned you for 25 years. You could get hurt again. First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason. Which was? I don't know. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me. Oh, Homie. Come on! You're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son. Then why did she leave me? Let's find out. Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past. Can't reminisce. Sleeping. Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops! Please don't! All right. Then we'll call your husband. Grampa! No! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything. I've wanted to tell you. It all started in the '60s. Take out wrenched ankle. Mom! Mom! Mom! Oh, my little Homie Bear. Time for bed. Sing me my bedtime song, Mom. Mm. Darn tootin'! Here's the tricky part. Abe, isn't Homer cute? Probably. I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl. If people don't support this thing, it might not make it. Joe Willie Namath swaggering off the field... his sideburns an apogee of sculpted "sartorium"- the foppish follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside... Appomattox, 1865. His wild, untamed facial hair... revealed a new world of rebellion, of change- a world where doors were open for women like me. But Abe was stuck in his button-down... Plastic Fantastic Madison Avenue scene. Look at them sideburns! He looks like a girl. Now, Johnny Unitas- there's a haircut you could set your watch to. So, Mother Simpson, where did your newfound sense of irresponsibility take you? I soon found people who shared my views at the state college. Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear. Get your germ lab out of here! Now! Now! How could I not become a radical... when we were fighting a force of pure evil? Hey, hey, Mr. Burns.! Enough already with the germs. Ptooh their flower power- it's no match for my glower power. Well, that's some nice glowering, Mr. "B." We'd met the enemy, and it was Montgomery Burns. Drastic action had to be taken to stop his war machine. I put Homer to bed, Abe. And now I'm going out. It could be a late night. I'm meeting my destiny. So long. When this baby goes off, Burns's lab is gonna be history, man! Germ history! Oh, man! I got the munchies. Oh! No! Wait a minute. Bronchial tubes clearing. Asthma disappearing. Acne... remains. But asthma disappearing. My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul. They never even had a chance. Whoever did this will never get past me. You poor man. Let me help you up. You just made a very big mistake. You'll spend the rest of your life in pri- My asthma's gone! Listen to me breathe. From that moment on, my life as I knew it was over. Only one member of the Springfield Seven was identified. She's been described as a woman in her early 30s... yellow complexion and may be extremely helpful. For Channel 6 News, I'm Kenny Brockelstein. Homer. I'll miss you, Homer. I thought I dreamed that kiss. I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom. You had to leave to protect your family. How did you survive? Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes... I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook... and I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership. Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me? But I did. I sent you a care package every week. Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp. But I did. I really did. I'll prove it to you. Any undelivered mail for HomerJ. Simpson? No. Oh, wait. This. That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas. Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aeromail. Am I too late for the 4:30 autogiro? Um, better look in the manual. Ignorance. Wait a minute. I know that woman. But from when? And in what capacity? It's her.! At last! This book must be out of date. I don't see Prussia, Siam or autogiro. Keep looking! Are you sure this is the woman you saw in the post office? Absolutely. Who could forget such a monstrous visage? She has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career criminal. Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago. Of course you'd say that. You have the brainpan of a stagecoach tilter. At any rate, the F.B.I. will track down this mystery woman... and put her behind bars. How does it happen, Joe? How does what happen? How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future... for a bunch of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises? Maybe she thought the war in Southeast Asia was so immoral her end justified the means. Gee, Joe. You haven't been the same since your son went crazy in Vietnam. It's a pain that never ends. Seven! No, Dad. It's a rhetorical question. Rhetorical, eh? Eight! Dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means? Do I know what rhetorical means? Quick, Grandma! Hide! No door is gonna keep me from my meddlin'! Stand up straight, Bart. Abe? What the- Now, here's a piece of bad news. Oh, Abe! You've aged terribly. What do you expect? You left me to raise the boy on my own! I had to leave! But you didn't have to tell Homer I was dead! It was either that or tell him his mother was a wanted criminal! You were a rotten wife, and I'll never ever forgive you! Can we have s*x? Please? Oh, Abe! Well, I tried. What's for supper? Yeah. I might've seen her. It's hard to tell from this old picture, you know? Well, according to our computer-aging program... she should look about... 25 years older. Yeah, I seen her. Uh, that is to say, I saw her. Look at me, Grandma. I'm a hippie. Peace, man. Groovy. Bomb Vietnam! Four more years! Up with people! You know, Grandma, I used to think maybe I was adopted. I couldn't understand how I fit into this family. Now that I've met you, I suddenly make a lot of sense. I'm so glad to see the spirit of the '60s is still alive in you kids. Yep. I saw her. That is to say, I seen her. She seemed like a nice lady. Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare back 30 years. We're only now finally caught up. Two more ladies come by earlier that day. One was real pretty. Tother, sort of plain. Ma'am, we're gonna need your assistance in locating this individual. You're fresh. Don't you want to play "good cop, bad cop"? Ma'am, we're all good cops. I had no intention of playing the good cop. Look, we know you bought the tombstone. We know the fugitive visited that tombstone. Whose tombstone was it? Just lift up your coffee cups and see. Good lord! Put out an A.P. B... on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh. Uh, better start with Greek town. That's HomerJ. Simpson, Chief. You're reading it upside down. Uh, cancel that A.P.B. But, uh- Oh, bring back some of them, uh, gyros. Uh, Chief, you're talking into your wallet. Grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield? You could live with Grampa again. Oh, I'm a living joke. You know, Lisa... it might be nice to rest for a while. Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about. But could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen? I've been waiting 25 years for this moment. Huh? I'm sorry, sir. I must've taped over that. Freeze! F.B.I. The jig is up. All right, I admit it. I am the Lindbergh baby. Waah! Waah! Goo, goo. I miss my fly-fly dada. Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile? A little from column "A," a little from column "B." Sir, she's gone! We made it, Homer! It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you? And why did you tip us off? Well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma... that was keeping me out of the academy. Thanks. Sure. Just think of me as an anonymous friend... who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police... to become Chief Clancy Wig- Yak, yak. Yak, yak, yak. Well, there's my ride. The underground awaits. At least this time I'm awake for your good-bye. Oh, Homer. Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother... and she's truly proud of you. Oh.! Hurry up, man.! This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left! Don't forget me! Don't worry, Homer. You'll always be a part of me. D'oh!
#07x09 - Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming^ I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's Canned Food Drive. Your generous donations... have made this our slipperiest, slimiest slobstacle course ever! Our contestants will drop out of my nose and blurp into a tub of refried beans. From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of rich, eggy béarnaise sauce. How can we afford it? It's rancid! Uhh- And at the finish line... a scrumptious parfait of pudding, pickle brine and detergent... where a writhing pile of kids will grope blindly for hot dogs! Krusty, please! It burns! Oh, just think, Lise. That's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel. That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob? Don't you remember, Dad? He framed Krusty, he tried to kill Aunt Selma... he rigged an election- And he tried to murder me.! Oh, yeah. But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now. Ah, Westminster Abbey. Edward the Confessor himself could not have done better. Now to set the clocks to Greenwich mean time. My dear abbey! This is the way we mop the floor, mop the floor mop the floor Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal television? Oh, look who's talking. Yeah, Bob. You used to be on this show. Don't remind me! My foolish capering destroyed more young minds than syphilis and pinball combined. Oh, how I loathe that box... that omnidirectional sludge pump droning and burping- Look here! That's enough now! I own 60% of that network! All right, break it up, boys. It's time for work detail. I suppose you don't like tabloid newspapers either. There. That's the last condom wrapper. Oh, I renew my objection to this pointless endeavor. Informally now and by affidavit later, time permitting. Shut your word-hole! We gotta get this place clean for the air show. Air show? Buzz-cut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their whizz jets... to the strains of "Rock You Like a Hurricane"? What kind of country-fried rube is still impressed by that? Yeah! Yeah. I want to meet the first female stealth bomber pilot. During the Gulf War, she destroyed 70 mosques. And her name is Lisa too. I want to see some birds get sucked into the engines, rare ones. This year I'm making ear plugs out of biscuit dough. They're ready. So weary. Grandma, this is my friend, Craig. Friend? You mean you two aren't knocking boots? Ever do the back-seat mambo, Craigie? I know that voice. TV's bottomless chum bucket has claimed Vanessa Redgrave! Now I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza. Yee-haw.! Farewell, dear 'Nessa. Hey, you.! The state's not paying you five cents an hour to stand around. Now, get busy! Oh, I'll get busy. I'll get very busy, indeed. You still got it, Bob. Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun! I have three medals for this. Hey! Where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who, uh, eats people and takes their faces? I'm right here, Chief. Oh. Then where's Sideshow Bob? Uh, he ran off. Oh, great. Well, if anyone asks, uh, I beat him to death, okay? Right. At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention... to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently standing. The Harrier jet is one of our more dollar-intensive, ordnance-delivery vectors. Five tires? Am I seeing things? Uh, and although it looks complicated... it's so well-designed, even a child could fly it. Can I fly it? Of course you cannot. Free Duff? Viva life! Mm. Uhh- Take that, Mom! Take that, Dad! Send me to a psychiatrist, will you? Take that, Dr. Sally Waxler! Uh, Colonel, they're expecting you at the podium in 10 minutes. I'm, uh- Hmm. What in the World According to Garp? Those are my dress towels! Who's in my private washroom? McGuckett, let me in. The door already is closed. What? This is Colonel Leslie "Hap" Hapablap. If you don't open that door, I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a snot party! You say you're in the military? Sweet Enola Gay, son! I'm gonna come in there and corpse you up! Corpse you up and mail you to mama! Well, where'd he go? Oh, got my knuckles all lined up for nothing. Sorry, ladies. Look at that hunk of junk. Not jun- You're ignorant! That's the Wright Brothers' plane. At Kitty Hawk in 1903... Charles Lindbergh flew it 15 miles on a thimbleful of corn oil. Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did. So, how do you know so much about American history? I pieced it together mostly from sugar packets. Authorization code? Code? Son, this is Colonel Hapablap! That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck Yeager's Acura. Now get down there with the chamois triple-time! But, Colonel, I'm under strict orders to- Sweet Enola Gay, son! Get moving or I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a, uh, snot party. Sir, right away, sir! They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes. Maybe my headache will go away once the show starts. Uh, ladies and gentlemen... what a day for an air show! Not a cloud in the sky.![/i] Except perhaps... a mushroom cloud. Oh, forget it. To slip the surly bonds of Earth... and touch the face of God. To fly! The dream of man and flightless bird alike. And now, hold on tight... as we blast through the thrilling highlights of aviation history! Say! Did somebody say box kites? No.! The common box kite was originally used as a means of drying wet string. Do they have to play that rock music? Every note is pounding into my skull. Anybody out there feel the need for speed? Yay! Yay. Then get ready for the pride of the United States Air Force! The British-made Harrier Jump jet! Dad, why aren't you looking? Why jerk my neck around like a goon... when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at? Ooh, look! It's Maggie! Uh, Maggie? Sideshow Bob! Hello, Springfield. Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things. But something's been troubling me lately- television! Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with? What? Surely he's not talking about VH1? Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus I submit to you, we abolish television... permanently! Go back to Massachusetts, pinko! Oh, and one more thing. I've stolen a nuclear weapon. If you do not rid this city of television within two hours... I will detonate it. Farewell. By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it. So don't bother pointing that out. Kids, everything's gonna be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic! Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off! We can always get more shoes. Move, move, move! Stamp your hand for reentry. Hey! Cool! I want to be around when those guns start going off. Bart! No! Wait! Wait! My children are in there! You must be very proud, ma'am. Our city will not negotiate with terrorists. Is there a city nearby that will? No need, sir. We'll find that head case faster than Garfield finds lasagna. Oh. I'm sorry. My- My wife thought that was gangbusters. This elevator only goes to the basement. And someone made an awful mess down there. Watch out.! He's got his probe.! Bart! Bart! What are you doing? We've got to get out of here! Target sighted! Launching air-to-nerd missile! Ow! Come on! Mom and Dad are waiting! Bob is not here. We have searched every square inch of this base... and all we have found is porno, porno, porno! We have only 20 minutes left. Send in the esteemed representatives of television. Hey, hey! Now, this is my kind of meeting! Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able. We must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our townspeople. Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! Let's not go nuts! Would it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the survivors would envy the dead. I appreciate your passion on behalf of your medium. But I'm afraid we're out of options. Television must go. May God have mercy on our souls. And as my final newscast draws to a close... I'm reminded of a few of the events that brought me closer to you. The collapse of the Soviet Union, premium ice cream price wars... dogs that were mistakenly issued major credit cards and others who weren't so lucky. And so, farewell. Uh, and, uh, don't forget to look for my new column in PC World magazine. Success! They're giving in! Blast! I should have made more demands! Some decent local marmalade, for one. Oh, well, next time. Not my extendo-glove! Oh, they haven't made those since the war. Not- Oh, not my Paris backdrop! How am I gonna make fun of the Frogs? Wait. If I could only stay on the air... I'd have 100% of the audience. Think of the ratings. Okay, so we can't go over the fence. I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them? I'm sure they're fine, honey. Hmm. Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear. Free and easy, Lise. There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort. Huh? Hurry up. Mom and Dad are probably worried sick. Do you know what really frosts my Kelvinator? That fruitcup's probably still laughing at us from his damn hidey-hole. I'd rather take an order from Bill Clinton... than hear that guy's snooty, high-toned voice again, sir. "High-toned voice." Bart, that's it. I know where Sideshow Bob is hiding. When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. And what makes your voice high? Tight, binding underwear? Helium! Sideshow Bob is in the Duff blimp! All Springfield trembles before the might of Sideshow Bob. Blasted helium! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! That's better. Gone. Gone too. Fabulous. Marvelous. This is the emergency broadcast system. Stand by for an urgent bulletin. Hey, hey! Krusty the Clown is back on the air! Eight- No, no! Twelve hours a day! The only game in town! Krusty! But how? Coming at you live from the civil defense shack... in the remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield badlands. I'll be beaming out 11 watts of wackiness! Hour after hour of unscripted, unrehearsed comedy... featuring, uh, you know, uh, Professor Gas Can! Uh, and, uh, former president, Ike Eisenhower! Let's get busy! Oh! My utopia lies in ruins. How naive of me to think a mere atom bomb could fell the chattering Cyclops! Well, at least I'll have my revenge! Bob, no! Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out. I agree. "Best before November 1959." Damn it, Bob! There were plenty of brand-new bombs. But you had to go for that retro '50s charm. Well, if it isn't my arch nemesis, Bart Simpson... and his sister, Lisa, to whom I'm fairly indifferent. So Krusty double-crossed you. But your basic plan was pure genius. Where do you get your ideas? Oh, please! Let's not embarrass us both... with that hoary old stall-the-villain-with-flattery scheme. I- I should've known you were too smart to fall for that. Really? What type of smart? Book smart? Because there are a lot of people who are book smart. But it takes a very special type of genius to- All right, Bob. It's over.! Come out with your hands up.! No! How did they find me? He's getting away! Oh, not the Harrier! We've got a war tomorrow. God bless the idiot-proof Air Force. They're gone! Hell! Not the Wright Brothers' plane. The Smithsonian's gonna have my ass on a platter. Dad! Help! Hang on, boy! Daddy's coming to save you! D'oh! Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hideout! And I got a secret message to the police! And I had a blimp fall on me! And I was in an atomic blast! But I'm okay now! Well, I wrecked the gate. But you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll! Ah, for the days when aviation was a gentleman's pursuit. Back before every Joe Sweat Sock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray... and jet off to Raleigh-Durham. Are you getting lots of bugs in your mouth too? Yes. Prepare to engage enemy. Bogie's air speed not sufficient for intercept. Suggest we get out and walk. Jump, boy! I got you! I'm coming! Now you, boy. You can't escape, Bob. If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will. Oh, I- I never planned to escape. You see, this is a kamikaze mission. You and I are going to kill Krusty the Clown! Kids, Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today. But instead, we've got the next best thing. It's The Stingy and Battery Show.! They bite and light and bite and light and bite. You know what I'm talking about. Uh-oh. You can't kill Krusty. He made you what you are. Without him, you wouldn't even be called "Sideshow." What the hell is that? A lawn mower? Get out of the way, Krusty! What is the freakin' holdup? Die, Krusty! Die- Oh. Ooh, sorry. Uh, we don't normally drive these in the Air Force. Gotcha! Ya TV-hatin' mutant. What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob? Oh, my little sugar bun. I'm so glad you're safe. But- But- But- But, M-M-Mom! You're embarrassing me in front of the army guys. How ironic. My crusade against television has come to an end so formulaic... it could have spewed from the PowerBook of the laziest Hollywood hack. Hey, everybody! I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza! Here we go again. Here we go again.
#07x10 - The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular^Live, from the Springfield Civic Auditorium- it's "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular.!" Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such Fox Network specials as... Alien Nose Job, and five fabulous weeks of The Chevy Chase Show. Tonight, we're here to honor America's favorite... non-prehistoric cartoon family. You'll see long-lost footage... never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes... old favorites you can't see in syndication. So join me, won't you, for "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!" The Simpsons D'oh! The Simpsons began as the brainchild... of cartoonist Matt Groening... the already-famous creator of such comics... as Damnation, Johnny Reb... and True Murder Stories. In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers... James L. Brooks... and Sam Simon.[/i] And what better place to premiere their creation... than on The Tracy Ullman Show- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes... and musical comedy numbers. On April 19, 1987, America first met The Simpsons.[/i] Well, good night, Son. Um, Dad? Yeah? What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses... or is it something tangible? Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind. Thanks, Dad. Good night, Son. Good night, Lisa. Good night, Mom. Sweet dreams. Thanks, Mom. Sleep tight. I will, Mom. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Bedbugs? Sweet dreams. We may be the best parents in the world. Mm. Good night, dear. Good night. All right. Climb in. There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone, go to sleep. Good night. Di-da. They haven't changed a bit, have they? As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons. Fresh chocolate chip cookies. Oh! Don't touch those yet. They're very, very hot. Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime. Yow! Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies? They're all gone, the whole batch. Somebody ate those cookies. Did you eat the cookies, Maggie? I think she's trying to tell us something. Go on, Maggie. Go on, Maggie. Go! Go! There's no perfect crime. Ohh! I've got a great idea. Let's play Space Patrol.! I'll be Lee Suey, the devil-may-care rocket pilot. And Maggie can be Medina, your spunky sidekick. And you'll be- Bartron, the evil robot from Mars gone berserk. Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the Helmet of Evil Thoughts... with my enchanted space wand? Yes! Yes! Yes! I will do it, Bartron. But who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed? Oh, no. Inside the evil Bartron... is a horrible, mutant boy.! We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad... the Evil Overlords, get home. As wacky as those kids were... they were no match for Captain Wacky, later renamed "Homer." Wake up, everybody! It's World War III! Quick.! Down to the fallout shelter.! The bombs are dropping.! Eighteen seconds. Hmm. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what? Bart.! Bart.! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy.! Gotta hide. Bart.! Huh. Where are ya, boy? Oops. Aha! There ya go! Now, that's not so bad, is it? Scrub good now. Ahh. Welcome to zee exotic world of undersea explorer... Bart Simpseau. Come with Bart as he dive into zee briny deep... searching for the wily and elusive washcloth. Suddenly, without warning, zee brave boy get more than he bargain for. Help! Help! Help! Help! Clean as a whistle, Homer. Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters were there. Itchy and Scratchy, Grampa Simpson... and Krusty the Clown. When we return, more classic moments- and, for the first time on TV... our private reel of Simpsons outtakes... including the alternate endings to, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" The cash register says, "N.R.A.4ever." Just one of the hundreds of radical, right-wing messages... inserted into every show by creator Matt Groening. Over the six years The Simpsons has been on the air...[/i] we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know... more about the show. Tonight, we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes: "I think Homer gets stupider every year." That's not a question, professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves. Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me. Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name? I don't know. Well, Homer, maybe you can take some consolation... in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. "Ooh! Look at me. I'm making people happy. "I'm the magical man from Happy Land... in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane." Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Well, duh. Yabba-dabba-doo! Simpson, Homer Simpson. He's the greatest guy in history. From the town of Springfield. He's about to hit a chestnut tree. Hey, guys. Look what I smuggled aboard. Homer, no! Huh? They'll clog the instruments! Careful! They're ruffled! I'll take care of this. Ahh- Mmm. Ants! No TV and no beer make Homer something something. Go crazy? Don't mind if I do! Dr. Linus lrving of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial lnstitute writes: "How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw... an entire Simpsons episode every week?" For the answer to this, we went straight to the source. Get outta my office! Of course, what Matt meant to say... according to his attorneys, is that he couldn't possibly do it alone... and he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone... who makes The Simpsons possible. Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the lvory Coast writes: "What is the real deal with Mr. Burns's assistant, Smithers? You know what I'm talking about. " Of course we do. The preparations for your birthday have begun. I won't get what I really want. No one does. Happy birthday, Mr. Smithers. Mmm. People like dogs, Mr. Burns. Nonsense. Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch... and slobbering all over your face, what would you say? Mmm. If you did it, sir? I'll, uh, print you out a copy. Thanks. Hello. Smithers. You're. Quite. Good. At. Turning. Me. On. Um, you probably should ignore that. Hmm. I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed, and they fly in through the window? Ahh. As you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers... is that he's Mr. Burns's assistant. He's in his early 40s, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing. We'll be right back. If you said "Bleeding Gums" Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe... you are wrong- they were never popular. Right about now you're probably saying... "Troy, I've seen every Simpsons episode. You can't show me anything new." You've got some attitude, mister. Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long... and certain scenes never get aired. So, fire up your VCR, because here, for the first time ever... are the cutout classics. When Krusty the Clown got canceled- he tried everything to stay on the air. Here's what you didn't see. If you watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me... in a variety of sexually explicit positions. What? Oh. Hey! It's not really me. I used a stunt butt. Krusty, we're from the network. We have some bad news. I'm afraid your show's been canceled. I thought this would happen. I just hope you replace me with something as educational... and uplifting as I tried to be. Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins. Can I play "Hemorrhoid Sufferer Number One"? Ooh! Oh, that hurts! Aah! Oh, is there no relief? I don't think so. Well, how about one of the "after" guys? Ahh! Oh, that's better. I can ride a bike again! Sorry. Ohh. When Springfield legalized gambling... Homer became a blackjack dealer... and comedy was "in the cards." Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bond. I'll take a hit, dealer. Joker. You were supposed to take those out of the deck. Oh, sorry. Here's another one. What is this card? "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?" What a pity, Mr. Bond. But-Well, it was Homer's fault. I didn't lose. I never lose. Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world domination. I'm not going to fall for that one again. Earlier this year, Homer's long-lost mother returned... and so did a long-lost care package. Mmm. Homer, please. You don't have to wolf down that 25-year-old candy... just to make me happy. But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space food sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure. Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom? Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean- It was national news. Do you... still work for NASA? No, I work at the nuclear power plant. Oh, Homer. Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside. When Homer sold his soul for a doughnut... he found out that hell isn't all it's cracked up to be... in these never-before-broadcast scenes. Mm, lawyers, lawyers, lawyers- Ooh, Lionel Hutz! "Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free. " Hmm. I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car. That can be arranged. Changed my mind. Sorry. Cool. Bart, stop pestering Satan! Your Honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul... is legally the property of Marge Simpson, and not of the devil. Ohh. Yea! Whoo-hoo! Ow! Well, I didn't win. Here's your pizza. But we did win. That's okay. The box is empty. If that's what they cut out, what they leave in... must be pure gold! Let's watch some more of those fabulous Simpsons outtakes. Apu living with the Simpsons? It happened. And here's a scene you didn't see. I'm hoping you enjoy this movie. It made every lndian critic's Top 400 list. This movie you rented sucks. No, it doesn't. It's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'. A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation... with his estranged son. Watch. Bart, you're coming home. I want to stay here with Mr. Burns. I suggest you leave immediately. Or what? You'll release the dogs, or the bees... or the dogs with bees in their mouth... and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well, go ahead. Do your worst! My worst, eh? Smithers... release the robotic Richard Simmons. Come on, big boy! Shake the butter off those buns! Come on, girls. Shake, shake, shake. Smithers, it's out of control. I'll take him out, sir. His ass is gonna blow! This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery... of"Who Shot Mr. Burns?" Then they found out it was the baby. To keep this bombshell secret... the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air. And to keep the show's animators, editors... staff and hangers-on from leaking the solution... two completely different endings were produced. One real, one phony. Here's the ending you were never meant to see. The one who shot me was- Waylon Smithers! No-o! Wait a minute. Yes. With the sun-blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world. So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth. I feel like celebrating. Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt... to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture... I was free to wallow in my own crapulence. Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur... lurched out of the darkness and fired.! That's right. Right before I shot Jasper. Hmm. I was busy that night. Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid. But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial. Then, with your last ounce of strength... you pointed to "W" and "S". Waylon Smithers! I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've recovered... and we can all get back to normal. Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me... I'm giving you a five percent pay cut. Ohh! But, of course, for that ending to work... you would have to ignore all the Simpson D.N.A. evidence. And that would be downright nutty. Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way... since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters... to pay off his gambling debts. Who knows what adventures they'll have between now... and the time the show becomes unprofitable? I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see: hard-core nudity!
#07x11 - Marge Be Not Proud^It's a Krusty Kinda Kristmas.! Brought to you by I LG- selling your body's chemicals after you die. And by Li'I Sweetheart Cupcakes, a subsidiary of I LG. Oh, hi! I didn't hear you come in. Welcome to my home. And- Ho-ho! Say, did I hear some carolers? Hey! It's respected private citizen, Tom Landry! And South American sensation... Shooshisha- Shooshashi- Shoosh- Oh, boy! Uhh! Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card... from Tupac Shakur. Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish. Christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship Jesus Christ. Boring! Help! You want excitement? Shove this up your stocking! Ooh-hoo-whoa! Hmm, that looks entertaining. Oh, yeah! So tell your folks, "Buy me Bonestorm... or go to hell!" Buy me Bonestorm or go to hell! Bart! Young man, in this house we use a little word called "please." It's the coolest video game ever. I'm sorry, honey... but those games cost up to, and including, $70. And they're violent, and they distract you from your schoolwork. Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game. I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age... I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world. And my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, good night. Oh, I'll never get that game. Tuck-in time! All aboard the sleepy train to visit Mother Goose. Barty's stop is Snoozy Lane to rest his sweet caboose. Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore. Tuck-in time is lame. Well, if loving my kids is lame, then I guess I'm just a big lame. Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame. Well, life is like a box of chocolates. Mom, no! Mom! You never know- what you're gonna get. what you're gonna get. Ninety-nine cents? I want to buy a copy of Bonestorm. Here's 99 cents. Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction. You wish to purchase Bonestorm for 99 cents. Net profit to me, negative $59. Oh, oh, please take my $59. I don't want it. It's yours. Eh, eh, eh! Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm... I shall close the register at this point and state that 99 cents is the rental price. Oh, then may I please rent it, please? You may not. I am all out. Though I do have a surprising abundance... of Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge. Ohh! Milhouse has Bonestorm! This is great! And all I've done is enter my name-Thrillhouse! Say, cool dude, can I play too? Uh- Uh, it's only a one-player game. Then how come it says "second player score"? Mom! Bart's swearing! Hey! What the hell- No, no, no! Out! Damn it, I wasn't swearing! Out right now! Out! Hmm. Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad... someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one. Gavin, don't you already have this game? No, Mom, you idiot! I have Bloodstorm and Bonesquad and Bloodstorm II, stupid! Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We'll take a Bonestorm. Get two! I'm not sharing with Caitlin. That must be the happiest kid in the world. Psst.! Hey, Simpson. Check this out. Look what I got! It's the kind I like. Are you guys shoplifting? Four-finger discount, dude. Shoplifting is a victimless crime... like punching someone in the dark! Yeah! Go ahead-a, Bart. Take-a the Bonestorm. The store, she's so rich she'll-a never notice. Duh, it's the company's fault for making you want it so much. Don't do it, son. How's that game gonna help your putting? Just take it! Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it! Take it! I'm outside. I got away with it. I'm free! Sir, would you open your coat, please? Uhh, I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens. Please step back in the store, sir. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That boy's parents must've made some terrible mistakes. Shut up, Mom! Ho-ho-ho! Here you go, little fella. No, no. None for him. Oh, I see. Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such public service videos as... Designated drivers: The Lifesaving Nerds... and Phony Tornado Alarms Reduce Readiness. I'm here today to give you the skinny on shoplifting, thereby completing my plea bargain... with the good people at Foot Locker of Beverly Hills. Shoplifting began here in ancient Phoenicia. Thieves would literally lift the corner of a shop... in order to snatch the sweet, sweet olives within. Oh, Sheheqazaramesh, will you ever learn? Flash forward to ancient Babylonia. All right, show's over. Uh, excuse me- You think you're pretty smart, don't you? No. Don't smart off to me, smart guy. I-I-I could pay for the game. I-I'll pay for it! You know, that kind of mush might fly at Lamps Plus, but don't peddle it here. If I wanted smoke blown up my ass... I'd be at home with a pack of cigarettes and a short length of hose. That's it, Mr. Comedian. I'm calling your parents. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson? This is Detective Don Brodka from Try-N-Save security. That's right, Don Brodka. Your son, Bart, has been caught shoplifting. Uh-huh. Yeah, it's a shame, I know... but, well, try and have a merry Christmas. They weren't home. Uh-huh. But I left a message on their answering machine. That's right. Um, okay. I've really, really, really learned my lesson. Can I please go now? Yeah, get out of my sight. Hey, kid. One more thing: If you ever set foot in this store again... you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall, capisce? Well, do you understand? Everything except "capeesh." Lousy, stinking piece of crap. Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh, God, I gotta change that tape! Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie! Hmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd. Hello, Muddah. Hello, Faddah. Here I am at Camp Granada. Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada? Now to put this tape... where no one will ever listen to it. Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is eggnog. 'Tis the season, Marge! We only get 30 sweet, noggy days. Then the government takes it away again. I think I'm having chest pains. Bart, get your suit on. What for? We're getting our Christmas picture taken. Ah, you lucked out, Marge, my man, 'cause I'm in a smilin' mood today. Well, good! So get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the Try-N-Save. Try-N-Save? Ah, my teapots are ready. If you ever set foot in this store again, you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall- juvenile hall-juvenile hall. Stand behind the yellow line.! You will now receive your Christmas presents... donated by the Port Authority Lost and Found Office. Pass your chit to Santa to receive your gift. If you do not have a chit, you will not receive a gift. Wow! The March 8 newspaper! Cool! A book of carpet samples! Come on, new bike! Ohh. A soiled wig. Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up. Oh, no, I'm not. What's the matter with your face? Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty? I don't have to listen to these wild allegations! Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo. Hey! I don't remember saying that. Uh-oh. Almost forgot to lock the doors. I hope you're going to the Valley Vista Try-N-Save, kid... 'cause you don't want to come to my store. Catfish? So, we're just gonna do this photo and get out, right? Bada bing, bada boom. I want to look at the pets, and write things on the typewriters... and see if the new dictionaries are in. Okay. I want to price some flip-flops, and smell the new tires... and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice! Sure! We're gonna have a great day! Bada bing, bada boom! Right, Bart? Bart? What's wrong, honey? Uh-oh! Somebody's got tired little legs. Hm! Uhh! Hmm. I wonder where the flip-flops are? Menswear? Maybe it's Sporting Goods. Wait, no, Sleepwear. Oh, probably Better Living. Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that. Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas. Now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover. Must've been a pretty slow century. The store detective! Hey, Ansel Adams, let's go! Take the photo! Oh, wait, wait! I don't want Maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier. Don't worry, Mama. I can put a smile on baby's face. Okay, sugar plum. It's time to meet Mr. Funny Voice. Hello, I'll- Oh, it's just air. Oh, come on! Hurry up! Okay, people. One, two, three. I thought I told you: no returns for busted merchandise. What are you doing to my son? I'm afraid your son broke the 11 th Commandment: Thou shalt not steal. That's crazy! Bart's not a shoplifter. He's just a little boy. Oh, sure. Now he's just a little boy stealing little toys. But someday he'll be a grown man... stealing stadiums and- and quarries. My son may not be perfect, but I know in my heart he's not a shoplifter. Fine, play the tape. Then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy. Wait! Mom, I don't want you to see this. I did it. Bart, I wouldn't have expected this even from you. My son's a thief. Oh, Bart. Stealing! How could you? Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain What's-his-name? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing! Did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Honk, honk! Where was I? Oh, yeah. Stay out of my booze! Mom, I'm really sorry. I know you are. Is there anything I can do? I don't know. Why don't you go to bed? Okay. Man, I thought Mom was gonna scream me stupid. She didn't even raise her voice. I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when she's really upset. Her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom countertop. It absorbs everything that touches it like this bathroom rug. Really? You think this might be... one of those forever-type things? I don't know. Lisa's on the sleepy train to rest her weary head. Her ticket is a candy cane made out of gingerbread. Good night, Mom. Good night, sweetheart. Oh, great. The Tuck-in Express is right on time. Good night. I've figured out the boy's punishment. First, he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second, no eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months. I always thought I understood my special little guy. But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine. Eh, what are you gonna do? He's not my little baby anymore. Maybe I mother him too much. Hey, Mom, you didn't wake me up. Here's your hot chocolate. You didn't put my marshmallow in. I think you're old enough to do it yourself now. Okay. I can handle that. Hey, give me a slice! Milhouse, do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving you? What? I'm more worried about piranhas. Did you see that movie where they sent a nuclear submarine to fight the piranhas... and one of them swims right down the periscope and bites the guy in the eye... and he goes, "Aah! Aah! Aah!" and that old lady told him it would happen? Yeah, that was pretty good. Hey, how come you're not playing Bonestorm? Ahh, it got boring. I'm really into this cup and ball now. Whoa! Wow! Man, you never know which way this crazy ball's gonna go! Yeah, right. You're just trying to trick me, 'cause you don't want me playing with your video game. Here, go ahead. No. Let me try the cup and ball. Get your own! Come on! Don't be a cup-and-ball hog! Hey, give it! That's mine! Give me the cup and ball, you cup-and-ball hog! Give it, give it! Come on, you little oink-oink! Mom! Bart's smoking! All right! Out, out, out! Go, go, go! But Milhouse-What are you- Okay, okay, okay. I won't bug Milhouse. Out! But, well, Mrs. Van Houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb... but can I hang out with you while you do mom stuff? Who are Dan and Sherry Adler? Just friends of ours. Oh. And who is Warren Burke? He used to tune our piano before we got rid of it. He grew up in Mechanicsburg. Oh, really? Hmm. Tell me I'm good. Oh, hey, that's Mom! She's happy again! You guys made a snowman family? Check it out, boy. It's like looking into a living snow mirror. Why didn't you wait for me? I didn't think you'd mind. I figured you were getting a little too old for this. But you can still make one. There's some snow left under the car. Stupid family. Hey, Simpson. Look what I swiped from Try-N-Save. It's a replacement tire for a wheelbarrow. Huh? I knew you'd like it. Everybody thinks I'm the black sheep. Well, I'll show 'em what a black sheep can do! Mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy. We're almost finished. There's just a little bit of green left. There you are. You can help me spray the cookies. Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket? Nothing! Oh, Bart, not again! Give it to me. I told you. I don't have anything. You can't hide from me in this house, Bart. I spend 23 hours a day here! Get him, Ma. There's no place left to run, Bart. Hand it over. Oh, Bart. I can't believe you did this. I wanted to surprise you for Christmas. Oh, sweetie, this is the best present a mother could get. I love you so much! My little, bitty Barty! Mom! Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early too. Bart get a present early? Then I should get a present early. I want a present! Lisa, you have to wait. Great. This is the worst Christmas ever. Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk... "Which is the one every boy wants?" You got me- Oh-h-h! Oh, yeah! Thanks, Mom.

#07x12 - Team Homer^Oh, my God! The Mad magazine special edition. They only put out 17 of these a year! Boy, they're really sockin' it to that Spiro Agnew guy again. He must work there or something. Let's do the fold-in. Okay. "What higher power do TV evangelists worship?" I'll say God. I'll say Jesus. "The almighty dollar"? You fold it, you bought it. Whoo! "Snappy answers to stupid questions." I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy. Does something smell funny in here? I don't think so, stupid. Homie, you want pork chops? No, I want roast beef, you clod! Look at this. Special insert: "Iron-on madness. Ban the bath. Don't trust anyone over 10. Sock it to me!" Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter. "The 'all-ighty ollar"'? I get it. Say, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny and Carl? They never come around anymore now that they got their mistresses. Might as well close the dump. I am gonna drink you under the table. No. I am going to drink you under the- Well, you're closin'. It's gettin' late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe! Think! Sorry. It's league night. I couldn't give a lane to my own mother. I have no son. Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people... you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what? For some pimply little puke that treats ya like dirt unless you're on a team. Well, I'm better than dirt. Well, most kinds of dirt. I mean, not that fancy, store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I can't compete with that stuff. That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well, but who am I to complain? Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wanna be a league bowler! Hey, we can be a team. Excuse me, but my team is ready to bowl. You're short one person. Uh... that long-haired freak's bowled with us for years. I don't care if it takes me all night. I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica. Come on, lobstie. Whoo. Oh, okay. Then I just need your $500 registration fee. $500! Oh, no problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party, bad check? No, I will not pay you $500 for s*x. Aw, come on, Marge. You're getting something in return, and I'm getting a bowling team. It's win-win. It's sick... and I don't have that kind of money to spend on s*x. Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team, like Mr. Burns. Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for $1,500. For what? Oh, I gotta get the third degree from you too? Tonight's homework assignment is- Oh, man, is it hot in here. I'd better take off my sweater. "Down with"- "homework"? Don't look at it, children. His shirt makes a good point. I'm with the shirt! Homework rots! Down with homework! Down with homework! Mmm. As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't have come at a better time. Well, Seymour, I must say, for once, I am impressed. In fact, I am going to give this school a perfect 10. I'll just write the zero first. Now a vertical line to indicate the one. Down with homework! Skinner, why are there children walking on my head? So, we meet again, Mad magazine. How do you know it's from Mad? The year was 1968. We were on recon in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt... with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan "up with miniskirts. " Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it. But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed Charlie to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a P.O.W. camp... forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables... prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States... but they just can't get the spices right. Uh, my punishment? Hmm? Oh, I'm gonna have to think about that. Meanwhile, wear this home. No-o-o. I need some more ether. I can still feel the movement of the emery board. We're fresh out, sir. I'll get some more. Leave the rag. Mmm. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burns. Pop 'n' Fresh, you glutinous little dough boy! There's something I've wanted to do to you for years. Ow. Mr. Burns, I was wondering if you'd like... to sponsor my bowling team for $500. Why, certainly, Pop 'n' Fresh. I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo. Whoo-hoo! Hey, everybody, if you wanna ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or somethin'! Uh, excuse me. I'd like to request $17... for a push broom rebristling. Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your Lucky Charms. Oh, no. My brains. Hey, nice, quote, uniforms, end quote. This just in. A new addition to our worst-dressed list: those guys! Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile... to withstand an evening of barbs like that. Oh, come on. If we quit now, we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us. Yeah, you're right. That's the kind of thing that would haunt ya. Hey! Sí. : Buenas noches, senoritas.! What did he say? What did he say? Was that about me? Okay, Otto. Pressure's on. Don't choke. Don't choke. Don't choke. Don't... choke. Oh, man! I knew I was gonna choke. That's a funny-lookin' strike. Come on, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto! Help each other out! That'll be our motto! You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto! Make this spare, I give you free gelato! Then back to my place, where I will get you blotto! Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto. You can do it, Otto! You can do it- Guys, I made the spare. We won. Yes! Yeah! All right! Those beers are five dollars apiece. Let me set the scene for you, Marge. All right. It's a 7-10 split, the hardest shot in bowling. Uh-huh. It was all up to me, so I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move... and I came up with a chant that won the match! Who knocked down the pins? I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess. Good for him. Yes, but, Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort. And I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me. I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal. Wow. But- Several days ago, a violent riot erupted... incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan. No, no. Now, don't try to remember what that slogan was. To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated... I've decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms. Huh? Uniforms? Say hello to our little genius, Martin, who looks even smarter... in this vest and short pant combination from Mr. Boy of Main Street. Or how about little Lisa Simpson? She'll have no reason to play the blues in this snappy ensemble... topped off with a saucy French beret... that seems to scream "silence. " All right. Pick your size: extra small or extra large. We've got both. No pushing now. I-What? Oh, I've just been informed we've run out of extra large. Go, Moe.! Go, Moe.! Don't make Homer shout out, "D'oh.!" Yeah! Yea! All right, Snake. Make us proud. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Bye! Ah, we forfeit. We'll take it. There it is, boys: the championship trophy. Whoo. We will never possess it. The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row. They think they're so high and mighty... just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants. God boy couldn't get a strike! It's me. Ned. Mom, my slingshot doesn't fit in these pockets... and these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck. Bart, where do you pick up words like that? Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night. Theyjust plain sucked. I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked. Homer, watch your mouth! I gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening. We are not wieners. Then what are you dressed like that for? They made us. Oh. "They made us." That's loser talk. You gotta start acting more like me and my team... the future league champions of the world. Nothing's gonna stop us now. Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling. Sir, that's a check for your boweling. Oh, yes. That's very important. Yes, sir. Remember that month you didn't do it? Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned. Anyway, back to the checks. Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling. Hmm. The memo says, "To my pal, Pop 'n' Fresh." Oh, yes. That greedy, grasping glob of chemicals. Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, sir. I'll check the employee files to see who could pull off such an impersonation. It was either Pops Freshenmeyer... or Homer Simpson. Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now. Come on, Homer. Come on, Homer. Pretend this is baseball and hit us a homer. You rolled it. You rolled it. By the way, rhyming "Homer" with "Homer"- Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their embezzlement. I have a much uglier word for it, sir: misappropriation. Simpson.! Listen here. I want to join your team. You wanna join my what? You wanna what his team? I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe- I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling. Oh, man. He'll blow our winning streak. Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must... but old people are no good at everything. Look, guys, it's not that simple. He's my boss. I'll tell you what. I'll give him a shot, and if he stinks... it'll be easier to tell him no. Ooh- Welcome aboard! It wasn't any easier. Ah, these uniforms are a godsend. Horseplay's down 40%. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half. High spirits are at an all-time low. They've even begun blinking in unison. I love that sound. Now, children, while you're having quiet time... I'm going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall. Oh, there's something I used... to do in this situation, but can't remember. Ha- ho? I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mr. Businessman. I bet I'll get a little respect once I get that Harvard diploma. Look at that. All the way to the end with only one push. That's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer. Mamma mia.! Hoot, mon! Yee-haw! Arr, me mateys. Arr. Whoo! They begged me to join their team- begged me. Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh, fellas? Well- Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game. Ah, yes, that silly championship. The only ship worth a damn is friendship. Look. Here comes the "friend ship" sailing your way. Ooh, here. Let me get that, friend. Oops. Lost a nail. Well, that's leprosy for you. You're it. Now you are the one who is it. Understood. Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour. These drab student coverings... have created the perfect distraction-free environment... thus preparing the children for permanent positions in tomorrow's mills... and processing facilities. Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave... absolutely nothing has gone wrong. Well, it is starting to rain, but I could hardly be blamed for that, can I? Yes. Very good. Wow! Look at all the colors, man! Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these! I'm freaking out! Hey, something's comin' back to me! Down with homework! And down with uniforms.! Yea! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Skinner... why aren't these uniforms colorfast? I don't understand it. I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses, and- Good Lord! Mother's in the park! This I've gotta see. Oh, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case. Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game, and you will win your championship. So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? Whoo-hoo! I won't need this anymore. Marge, someone broke the toilet. Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling... that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him... from bowlin' with us tonight, heh, heh, heh. Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight. My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again. Take that! Ooh! Smithers, that precision assault popped it back into place. Thank you, masked stranger! D'oh! He's gonna ruin everything! All right. That's it, Homer. Either Burns goes, or Moe goes. Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat... with my name in place of Moe's name. So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister? Oh, uh, Mr. Burns, as team captain... it's my duty to inform you that- Ooh, I almost forgot! I brought you all a little something. Aww, would you look at that? The "Pin Pals." At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in. I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever felt... rich. Aww. Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me. You're off the team. What? He's just ribbin' ya, Monty. Yes. Had you going there. Guys. Hey, hey, hey! Hallelujah. Hallelujah.! Aww. Nice one, Homer. Thanks. Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin... and we only have one bowler left: Mr. Burns. Hmm? Well, next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think? Good-bye, trophy. Ooh. Whatever I got ahold of is big. Yes! Excellent. Yes! Whoo-hoo! We won! We won! You mean, I won. But we were a team, sir. Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far. Then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll... of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta. I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change and then quickly change back. You know what? We don't need him or his trophy. We got each other, huh? Yeah, yeah. That's right, Moe. Aww. Go, Homer, you're our man! If you can't do it, nobody can! Ooh! No! Oh, God! Well, I guess no one can. Run, before they're through feeding! No.! Oh, God.! No.!
#07x13 - Two Bad Neighbors^Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware... it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview. Oh! Saturday afternoon TV is so boring. Bikini girls. Hmm? Dune buggies. Hmm! Daredevil surfers. Ordinarily this beach would be swarming with them, but not today. Oh, no! They've all been cleared out to make way for painstaking sand preparation. That's right, Dick. This year everyone's abuzz about one thing- the absence of Mark Rodkin. Oh, wait. There he is. Marge, I'm bored! Why don't you read something? Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom. You can hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale. You'll get some fresh air and exercise. Eh, I'll do it anyway. Come on, boy! We're going to see the neighbors. Good old Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates. If you love it so much, why are you always littering? It's easier. Duh! Oh! Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion? Eh, spray the boy. Well, ready for the big rummage sale? Oh, yes, indeed. I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishy machine. Hey, I never noticed this place. Dad, it's right across the street from us. That fancy house will never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood. Hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot! Too good to buy a house here, snobby? Who you talking to, Homer? The guy who doesn't live there. Can we get rid of this ayatollah T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago. But, Marge, it works on any ayatollah- Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi. As we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power. I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this. Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun! I need it to rhinestone up my old clothing. Who's "Disco Stu"? Oh. Well, I wanted to write "Disco Stud," but I ran out of space. Not that Disco Stu didn't get his share of the action. So, if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes... or an artificial Christmas tree, trunk only... come on over to the Hibbert table, pronto! Well, sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this. What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick? It is a candy dish, Ned. Ninety dollars. Uh-huh. Well, I, uh- I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there. No! Just candy, Ned. Ninety dollars! Well, looks like somebody sold something today. Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner? Hmm. It's awfully loud. Well, you can always take the motor out... and use it as an ordinary tie rack. But now the ties are motionless. Those in back are virtually inaccessible. Well, it's a moot point as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass. Have you sold that tie rack yet? No. I'll take it. Now, folks, nothing spells fun... like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket. Stu, you should buy that. Hey. Disco Stu doesn't advertise. Uh, hey, Ned, let me help you with that. Hey, everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up? So, anyone here from Evergreen Terrace? I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me? You're the king, Homer! King of the neighborhood! Say, that ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right? No! Yes. For only five dollars, you can sock it to him in style. Right here! And for the man who has everything, a tie-rack motor. I'll take that. Hey, big spender. Dig this blender. Rainbow suspenders. Hey, big spender. We surrender. Spend. Some dough at table three. Thank you, neighbors. Thank you. Now, let's give it up for table five! Ah, ah, ah, ah Table five, table five. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Table fi-i-i-ive. Table five. Table five. Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in. Disco Stu likes disco music. Hi there, neighbors. Uh, I'm George Bush. Former president George Bush? Oh, former president George Bush! Okay, let's give it up for the new guy! Now, let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. Hello. Hello! Hello! Wow! A former president living right across the street! Oh, why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot! Stupid president! Why couldn't he just stay in his own state? Actually, this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood. Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him- You didn't vote for anybody. I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical. And your business here, Mr. Flanders? Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association. Never mind about that, Ray. Just give 'em a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on in. Hey, Bar! The neighbors are here. Howdilly-doodilly there, President Bush- Or should I say President Neighbor? I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd. Howdilly-doodilly yourself there, Ned. This is my wife, Barbara. Call her Bar. Would you like some lemonade? Tiptop-notch! Okilly-dokilly. Thankilly-dankilly. Greatalicious. Scrumpdiddlerific. Fine and dandy like sour candy! Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren't you, Bar? Don't understand lemonade myself. Not my forte. What brings you to Springfield? George and I just wanted to be private citizens again... go where nobody cared about politics. So we found the town with the lowest voter turnout in America. Just happy to be here among good, average people... with no particular hopes or dreams. But, Mr. President, we're not all good people. There's one little boy you should watch out for. He's a bad, bad little boy. Now, Todd, don't scare the president. Oh, look at those phonies sucking up to Bush. I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong Bush. There it is, Homer. The cleverest thing you'll ever say, and nobody heard it. D'oh! Just gonna relax with my U.S. News & World whatnot. Oh, good. Roasting the new guy. Hello, Mr. Bush! George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson. He came over to say hi. Yeah. Hello. Hi! Hey, what's this? My electric card shuffler. Don't go near that- Now, I told you- Oh, those cards are from Air Force One... and they only give you so many packs. Oh, George! Boys will be boys. Bart's just being friendly. Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos? Oh, but he'll gunk 'em all up. His hands are probably covered with mud and cookies. He probably stole a napkin. Who's that, George? That's me with Charlton Heston. He was- Who's that, George? You wouldn't know him. That's Bob Mosbacher. He was secretary of- That's a dumb name. Who's that, George? Maybe he thinks "Bart" is a dumb- How many times were you president, George? Just once. Bar, isn't it time for dinner yet? I'm making rice. It'll be a while. Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George? You know, in my day... little boys didn't call their elders by their first names. Yeah? Well, welcome to the 20th century, George. I'll kick you right out of the 20th century, you little- Oh, man. I only got one minute till they stop serving those breakfast balls! D'oh! Ah, let's see now. What do you folks have here, huh? Hmm. A Krusty Burger. That doesn't sound too appetizing. What kind of stew do you have today? Uh, we don't have stew. Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger? That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray. Hey, jerk! Move your fanny! That guy's louder than World War II. Ray, go see what the rhubarb is, will you? Sir, could you pop your hood? Hey, my taxes paid for that horn! Why, hello, Mrs. Bush. Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping. Your husband's awful grumpy. Oh, that's just his way. He really likes you. You know, it's time for him to get up and work on his memoirs. Why don't you go wake him? What the- Great Scott! Don't touch that. That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me. Where'd you get those pajamas? They're presidential pajamas. You have to be president, and you're not president. Yes, I am. D- No, you're not. Bar! Hey, where's your candy? We don't have any. Now, go away! George! Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could bake you some cookies. Can't remember the last time she made cookies for me. What's that? Oh, n-nothing. All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it'll make you happy. Homie, as long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy. Well, you can always depend on that. And since I'd achieved... all my goals as president in one term... there was no need for a second. The end. Mmm. Good memoirs. Good, not great. Now, let's look at that old outboard. Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down Kennebunkport next May. Hello, Mr. Bush! What ya doin'? Now, don't upset the desk there. Careful! You don't want to horse around with- Hey, cool! What does this do? Now, don't you pull that cord, young man! No, no. Hey.! Whoops. Bar, my motor's gone loco! Oh, the birdhouse! My prize orchids! No. Not the memoirs. Don't even think about it. Not gonna happen. Whoa, man. Whoa nothing. I'm gonna do something your daddy should've done a long time ago. Now, go home and think about what you've done, young man. He spanked you? You? Bart Simpson? I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation. Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked by presidents till the cows came home. Grover Cleveland spanked me on two nonconsecutive occasions! Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common... but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment. And that's why your no-good kids are running wild! First, Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals... then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably. Now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it! Hey, Bush! Get out here! Excuse me, sir. Where are you going? I'm going to punch George Bush in the face. Okay. Is he expecting you? You owe me an apology! Hey, you owe me an apology. If you were any kind of a father... you'd have disciplined that boy a long time ago. You want to step back, sir? You're trampling the flowers. Ooh! Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Whoa! Well, you are a wimp! Wimp, am I? Agent Johnson, Agent Heintz... you men stand down. All right, mister, you want trouble, you're gonna get trouble. Oh, I want trouble, all right. Then you're gonna get trouble. No, you're gonna get trouble. Oh, that's good. That's good, 'cause I want trouble. Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble. Oh, yeah! Lots of trouble. Trouble it is! For you. D'oh! This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets, and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window. You get one up his butt, it's a million points. Why don't you just say you're sorry, George? Because I'm right. Oh, no. I'm gonna fix their wagon good. I've pulled some pranks in my time. I- I don't understand. Are you saying you and Barbara are bad neighbors? No! That's not Bar and me. It's them. Who? Maude and me? No! The man and his boy. You know, the- the boy is named Bart. I don't know the name of the man. Bar! What's the name of the man? I'm not getting involved, George. Look, just never mind. I thought the banner was pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll just take it down. George, it's time to get dressed. Nuh-uh. Not going outside today, not with those neighbors. Staying right here till my speech to the Elks Club. Yoo-hoo.! Who is it? It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad. Oh, good. Bar! The boys are in the front yard. They'll help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons. Oh, George! Is that all you ever think about? The boys probably just want a letter of recommendation. Boys? Where are you going? Okay, son. Give him the glue! Hey, lookin'good.! And that's why I will continue to oppose teen alcoholism... in all its forms. Now, are there any questions? Keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair. Oh, yeah, that's right. The Simpsons. President Bush is driving on our lawn. He must be lost. He's not lost. Looks like we're experiencing some blowback from the wig offensive. It's time to hit him where he lives. His house? Bingo. So I thought to myself, "What would God do in this situation?" Locusts. They'll drive him nuts. It's all in the Bible, son. It's the prankster's bible. Hmm. I can't decide if this'll be considered feisty or crazy. Hey! Hey, what the- Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer... he doesn't know George Bush. Hey, turkeys! Behind ya. For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy! Never. You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs. You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs. Never! Yea, Dad! I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge. George can be so stubborn when he thinks he's right. Oh, Homer too. They're so much alike. Too bad they got off on the wrong foot. It's just like the Noriega thing. Now he and George are the best of friends. Here's a little something we learned in C.I.A. Get him, boys! Ow! Ow! Hello! Hello! Now I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet. I'll take your head and- Gorbachev? What-What are you doing here? I just dropped by with present for warming of house. Instead find you grappling with local oaf. Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh? Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs got- George, this is the last straw.! You apologize to Homer right now! But, Bar, we can't show any weakness in front of the Russians. George! Yes, dear. Okay. I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer. Whoo-hoo! In your face, Bush. Now apologize for the tax hike. It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge... but George just felt this neighborhood brought out the worst in him and- Oh, my. Well, so long! Bye-bye. Hi! Pleased to meet you. I just moved in. My name is Jerry Ford. Former president Gerald Ford? Put 'er there. I'm Homer Simpson. Say, Homer, do you like football? Do I ever! Do you like nachos? Yes, Mr. Ford. Well, why don't you come over and watch the game... and we'll have nachos and then some beer? Ooh! Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just- D'oh!
#07x14 - Scenes From the Class Struggle in Springfield^Ay.!: Qué agonía.! Oh, he wants that corn so much. Ay.!: Dios no me ama.! I want to see what's on the other broadcasts. Where's the oscillator on this thing? No, Grampa! Don't! Dad, sit down! Gosh darn it! What does this do? Oh, I'll make my adjustments here and- Yea! We're getting a new TV! Let's go to the Sharper lmage. They've got a TV shaped like a '50s diner! No! Let's go to The Nature Company. They've got a TV assembled by Hopi lndians. We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. We just need a TV. We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville. Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name electronics! Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs. I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny. I'm not going to lie to you. Those are all superior machines. But if you like to watch your TV, and I mean really watch it... you want the Carnivalé. It features two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well... durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart. Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies. Honey, I don't think these clothes are us. Who are they? Hey, Brandine! You could wear this shirt to work. Oh, Cletis, you know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy Queen give me. Hey, Mom.! There's something in here.! Ooh! Oh, it's beautiful. Can it be a real Chanel? It is! Ninety dollars? But it's marked down from 2,800. Oh, you look so sophisticated. Just like Mary Hart. It fits like a dream too. But we can't afford $90, even if it is a bargain. It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe then- Come on, Mom! You never treat yourself to anything. Oh, sure I do. I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago. But this is a real find. Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything. Hmm. All right, I will buy it! It'll be good for the economy. You look great! Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special. Sperlock's Cafeteria it is. What about the symphony or the theater? Oh- What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway. Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today. Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register? Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen? Look at the craziness. Attendant, I'd like some gas. Yes, I'm sorry. I do not speak English. Okay. But you were just talking to- Yes, yes. Hot dog, hot dog. Yes, sir. No, sir. Maybe. Okay. Well, I can't pump it myself. I'm calling Triple "A." I used to be a little overwhelmed too. But it's not that hard. I can show you. Marge, is that you? Marge Bouvier from high school? Um, yeah. Hi. Hi, Evelyn. How about that? Marge, you look wonderful! And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson. I did marry Homer. Come. You must show me the pumps. Ninety percent of the time if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem. Automotive skills and fashion sense. Well, you've come a long way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school. We ran with different crowds. You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping... and I had my... home shoe-repair course. Oh, Marge, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know. Say, why don't you drop by the country club tomorrow? Oh, and bring the family! You there. Fill it up with petroleum distillate. And revulcanize my tires, posthaste. Bart, comb your hair! Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie. Oh, but Sipowicz does it. If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that too? Oh, I wish I was Sipowicz. Do I have to go? That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social climbers. I've told you, I don't like you using the word "hotbed." Please, Lisa. We so rarely get to do things like this. And, everybody, everybody please be on your best behavior. Bart, no grifting. Aw, raspberries. Name, please? Simpson family. We're not poor. Well, we're not. Go on in. They're expecting you at the clubhouse. Look at this! Livin' large! Oh, my! I've always dreamed of coming here. Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going to fit right in. Marge, you made it.! And you wore that lovely suit. Karyn, Gillian, Eliza-beth... Patri-cia, Robert-a, Su-san, meet Marge. Hi. How are you doing? Pleased to meet you. You look like such a happy bunch... of people. That's the trouble with first impressions- you only get to make one. Th-That reminds me of a funny apron I saw- You know, Marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove. They're free to enjoy the club. Uh, come on, kids. Let's go sit in the car till your mom's done fitting in. Eliza-beth is right. Why shout yourself hoarse at incompetent sales clerks... when you can get nearly everything mail-order? I won't eat anything unless it's shipped overnight from Vermont or Washington state. We order our steaks through The New Yorker. I have a sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey. I get food through the mail, but in a different way. Every month, Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself. Hmm. That's very true, Marge. One night, Wiff and I came home late, and we decided not to wake lris. Instead, we microwaved our own soup! Of course it was a horrible mess. But lris didn't mind cleaning it up. Didn't everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent. Like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual. That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels till I paid him to stop. Shoulda held out longer, boy. The rich are different from you and me. Yes! They're better! Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join. Boy, Marge! You must've really done a number on those rich suckers. Don't thank me. Thank my beautiful new suit. Fritz, you idiot! I didn't order a baloney sandwich! I ordered an abalone sandwich! I don't know what Mom's thinking. This whole country club scene is so decadent. All these spoiled... brats... and their... smug... complacent parents. It just reinforces the unspoken class system... of... horses... sitting on their high... horses- I'm sorry! I gotta go! Oh, we've got a winning hand! We can take the rest of the tricks. Oh, you'd better be careful. The purpose of this game is to make friends. You don't make friends by winning. Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner. Don't ask me. I'm just hair. Your head stopped 18 inches ago. Queen of hearts. I believe all the rest are ours. Oh, well played. We could've stopped them if you had changed to a different suit. I thought perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion. Eh, Marge? D'oh! Ho-ho-ho! Hoo-hoo! Ohh! Hmm! You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf... is to lower your score. That's one way. I'm P.G.A. Tour Pro Tom Kite. How about I give you a few pointers on your game? Now, you don't want to overthink. Not an issue. Keep your head down. Huh? Pretend there's no one else here. And just go at your own pace. Wow! Very impressive. You're a natural, Mr. Simpson. Really? Uh-huh. All you need is your own set of clubs. And stay the hell out of my locker! You can keep the shoes. Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap? Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow. Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, will you, Marge? Love your outfit, Marge. The vest says, "Let's have lunch," but the culottes say, "You're paying." Why, thank you, Robert-A! Mom, look.! I found something more fun than complaining.! Marge, your family is fitting in perfectly here. If all goes well at Saturday's ball... I'd love to sponsor you for membership. Oh, that would be a dream come true! I'll be there with bells on. Bells? Where exactly will you be attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit? Oh, don't worry, Marge. Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation... humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing. I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball, and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit. That's some fine chipping, Homer. Yeah. Can you bank it into the handicapped stall? Seat down. Hmm. Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers? Homer Simpson, sir. One of the fork-and-spoon operators from Sector 7G. Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle. Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh? Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, sir. I've never seen you lose a game. Except for that one in '74 when you let Richard Nixon win. That was very kind of you, sir. Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his... "I can't go to prison, Monty. They'll eat me alive!" Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation? Unlikely, sir. They-They spell and pronounce their name differently. Bah! Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself. This game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean, really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for. All right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your "whoo-hoo's." Please! We can't afford a single slip-up. They're judging us. Mwah. Mwah! Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard- I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one. Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons I like horses better than cars? One- I really need to concentrate on this. Would you mind just- You know how a horse goes like this? Mom! I've altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to- Whee! Whee! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Lisa, please! Hmm. No! No, no, no, no! At times like this I guess all you can do is laugh. I need a formal dress for tonight! You've come to the right place. We've got classy duds up the ying-yang. I call this one "Fantasy in Maroon." It's got some cigarette burns, but we can patch them up with Nu Vinyl. It's a bit peppery for me. Why don't we put this in the "maybe" pile? This was originally a Halloween costume... but it found its way into my regular rotation. Uh-huh. Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it? Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting... will only add savor to my inevitable triumph. Yes. Whoo-hoo! D'oh! Yes. You're in deep "d'oh" now. Perfect as always, sir. Right on the green. Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club- the sand wedge! Mmm. Open-faced club sand wedge. You're four strokes behind, Simpson. Oh, a cunning stratagem, sir. It's curving right toward the green. And it's... there! He got to the green in one shot? How can that old man... hit so far? Now, keep your head down. Ignore all distractions. Miss! Miss? Do you have a Chanel suit, or any other high-quality clothes? No, but we do have a shipment of slightly burnt Sears activewear coming in this afternoon. Oh, I give up. What time, and how burnt? Cripes, man! Can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots? Smithers, what are you doing up here? What are you doing with his ball? And all those other balls? Uh, there are no other balls. Just these, uh, reptile eggs! Oh, step away! They're endangered. These aren't reptile eggs. You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green! Cheating? For me? Good lord, Smithers! That's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers. In all of the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a- Oh. So you're not the best golfer here. Wait till I tell everyone about this. You stink. Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating... I'm sure he'd support your application for a membership tonight. Bull hockey! I don't care about joining this stupid club. But does your wife? Ohh! I knew my kind wasn't welcome here. Ooh! Ahh! Eee! Mom, you are looking fabulous! Yeah. You look great. You can do anything with that sewing machine. No, I can't. Come on, let's go. You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it? The outlet store. Wow! Two finds in one store. What are the odds? Call it fate. Let's go! How much did it cost? A dollar. Let's go! With tax or without? Without! Let me go! So, with tax, how much was it? Why do you always have to question everything I do? You look nice, is all. Homer, what are you doing? Driving up to the main building. They got valet parking tonight. We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. Were walking. But, Marge! Valets! For once maybe someone will call me "sir" without adding, "You're making a scene." I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Who's gonna bleep me this time? I'm gonna pose as an ltalian count... and get some old lady to leave me all her money. I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names. Or, in the case of butlers, their first. No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. Just be good! I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave. I won't say anything controversial. I just won't say anything. Okay, honey? You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person... we can see how awful we really are. Come here, Maggie. Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's- I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown. Our savings? Don't worry. I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel. They have beer and gum, right? Come on. Let's go. I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member. It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway. Well, I wonder where Marge could be. She's missing her own initiation. I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too seriously. Where's Homer? And to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake. Mmm! I- Ugh! Mmm! I- Ugh! I pickled the figs myself. Hey, did you guys just come from the prom? Sort of. But you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this. Man, you're crazy! This place is a dump. Oh, man! I'd be anywhere except this place. That's for sure.
#07x15 - Bart the Fink^May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing... of your Great-aunt Hortense. As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate. Poor Aunt Hortense. Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo. The only stipulation is that you spend one night... in a haunted house. Oh. Isn't that somewhat unusual? No. It's a standard clause. Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts. Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts. Best night's sleep I ever had. Their tap water tasted better than ours. Here you go- $100 each. The rest goes to Ann Landers... as was stipulated in your aunt's will. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have continued talking after you left the office. I do that sometimes. Oh, my. What are you gonna spend your money on, kids? There's a special on tacos down at the Taco Mat- hundred tacos for $100- I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna contribute my money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Tacos? Public broadcasting? I won't have you kids throwing away your money like that. You're both coming downtown with me, and you're gonna put that money in the bank. Boy, I sure could go for 100 tacos right about now. No. Yes, this should provide adequate sustenance for the Doctor Who marathon. You'll feel better knowing your money's... in the hands of professionals. "Ook, ook." Are you folks ready to go ape? Mom? A professional in an ape mask is still a professional. And you'll find that saving for your future... is far more thrilling than any roller coaster. Really? Wow! I should have started a long time ago. Mm-hmm. Now fill out these forms. I'm sure you'll find them more exciting than a weekend with Batman. I got their new Thrifty Saver savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. So a year from now I'll have an extra nickel. I got the account where you get free customized checks. I chose the Hindenburg flip-book series. Cool! Hmm. Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart. No, Mom, I can handle it. Let's see. Pay to the order of... Lisa- One cent, and no cents. And now the old John Hancock. There you go. Thank you. A million dollars? Thanks, Bart. I owe you one. That's a post-dated check, remember. Don't cash it till the year 10,000. Okay. Excellent. As soon as the check clears, I'll let you go. That's it. No more autographs. I gotta go. They're naming a new sandwich after me at my restaurant. It's okay, Bart. You can share mine. Quick! Press against me while the ink's still wet. No need. I'm going to get Krusty's autograph the easy way. If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. Then, when my monthly bank statement comes... I'll get the check back, complete with autograph. No fuss, no muss. That's a good plan... but it won't impress girls like this. Ew! Lisa's autograph. Apu's autograph. Oh, what do you know. Jimbo's real name is Corky. And... Krusty. Hey! "Cayman lslands Offshore Holding Corporation"? Krusty was supposed to sign this. Take it back and make him sign it. Uh, no, no. Stamping the back of a check is perfectly legal, little boy. Many people do it to save time. You see, in this case, instead of writing out his name... Krusty has stamped the name of his Cayman lslands Holding Corporation on the- Hmm. Uh, excuse me a minute. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't divulge information about that customer's secret, illegal account. Oh, crap. I shouldn't have said he was a customer. Oh, crap! I shouldn't have said it was a secret. Oh, crap! I certainly shouldn't have said it was illegal. It's too hot today. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I bought this popcorn fair and square. Sorry. The bank is- Oh, kid, gosh. I meant to tell you- Turns out that Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in history. And they nailed him, all thanks to you. Some might say you're a hero, kid. Not me, however. I love Krusty. Ladies and gentlemen, Krusty the Clown... was arrested today for massive tax fraud. Krusty's years of tax "avoision" would never have- What the heck is "avoision"? "Avoision"- It's a crime. Look it up. Would never have- "Evasion. " "Evasion." I don't say "evasion," I say "avoision." Would never have come to light if not... for a crafty little boy named Bart Simpson. Krusty's my hero. How could I do this to him? It is a tragedy for all us kids... but Bart, you can't beat yourself up. Yeah. There'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow. Oh, I can't go to jail! I got a swanky lifestyle. I'm used to the best. Krusty, this is America. We don't send our celebrities to jail. We're just going to garnish your salary. Garnish my celery? Please, Krusty. No jokes. Who's joking? Oh, I don't know what you're saying. It all sounds so crazy to me. It simply means we'll be taking part of your salary... until your debt is repaid. Say, 75% for 40 years. But I don't plan to live that long. Oh, better make it 95%. Oy. The lnternal Revenue Service presents... Herschel Krustofski's Clown-Related... Entertainment Show. Hey, hey, kids. Now that the Feds are calling the shots... this show's gotta be a lot more cost-effective. So we had to cut down on the frills... like sets, props, costumes and Sideshow Mel. But that doesn't mean we can't have fun. For example, I sure wish somebody would give me a banana cream pie. Yeah! Uh- I guess we can't afford pies right now. Well, throw something! Oh, that corner! Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers... one "I.R.S. -wich"- withhold the lettuce- three dependent-size sodas... and a "FICA-ccino." Fill out schedule "B." You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks. Well, let's see here. Add schedule "B" to line 53, take away the- Hey, Marge, what were your gambling losses last year? Seven hundred dollars. They took my money, they wrecked my show... they buried a bunch of stinking veterans in my family plot... but at least I still got my memories. Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion. And now, lot number 66, a handmade leather suitcase... carried by the Krustofski family... upon their arrival at Ellis Island in 1902. A priceless heirloom and historic piece of"Krustyana." What am I bid? Forty cents. I got 40 cents. Sold, for 40 cents. Forty cents? My grandpa Zev would turn over in his grave... if it wasn't filled with some veteran. Lot 67, 32 cartons of pornography. Ten cents. Twelve. Twelve cents to our phone bidder in Japan. Any other bids? All I brought is a dime. I didn't know there'd be pornography. Sold, for 12 cents. Oh, my beloved pornography. I can't watch this anymore. I'm going to bed. How much for Krusty's bed? Half a buck. Sold! Good night, everybody. Good night, Moe. And now lot number 2,380- Krusty's private plane... the I'm-On-A-Rolla Gay. But I love that plane. I used to fly to Vegas in it with Dean Martin. One night he looked out the window... and the moon hit his eye like a big pizza pie. We wrote a song about it... but it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before. Hey, Selma, that plane would go great with your new suitcase. Nah, I just bought it to soak my feet in. Krusty? Hi. Is it okay if I sit down here? Aah. Go ahead, kid. Knock yourself out. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty... but you know, my mom says... God never closes a door without opening a window. No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat. There's no silver lining here. I was a big cheese- a huge cheese! But now look at me. I gotta ride the bus like a schnook. I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot. I gotta wait in line with nobodies... to buy groceries from a failure! It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. As long as you're on TV, people will respect you. Respect? Pah! What good is respect without the moola to back it up? Everywhere I go I see teachers in Ferraris- research scientists drinking champagne. I tried to drink a Coke on the bus... and they took away my pass. That's no life for a famous clown. Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty... you can punch me in the face. Nah, forget it. Go home, kid. Shiva H. Vishnu! Where is that noise coming from? I must say, I've had a lovely evening, Agnes. I don't suppose I could come in for a cup of- Seymour! Mother. Superintendent Chalmers! Skinner! What I wouldn't give for something... to interrupt this awkward moment. That'll do nicely. You gotta hand it to Krusty. Yeah. Even with all his problems, he's still willing... to do something unbelievably dangerous... just to entertain his fans. Wow. Oh, that's my Krusty. I got a feeling he'll be all right. Oh, my God! Krusty's shoes! Okay, folks, show's over. Nothing to see here. Show's- Oh, my God! A horrible plane crash! Hey, everybody, get a load of this flaming wreckage. Come on, crowd around. Crowd around. Don't be shy. Crowd around. Ladies and gentlemen... Krusty the Clown is dead. I can't believe Krusty's really gone. Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in heaven right now... laughing it up with all the other celebrities- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin. I wish I were dead. We're gathered to mourn the passing... of Herschel Schmoeckel Krustofski... beloved entertainer and dear friend. Hello. I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such show business funerals... as "Andre the Giant, We Hardly Knew Ye"... and "Shemp Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge." Now, Krusty's closest friend and sidekick... Sideshow Mel. I'll miss you, Krusty- I and all the other Sideshows- except Sideshow Bob. But, in the midst of our sorrow... we can take comfort in the fact that your elevated blood-alcohol level... probably helped you burn up quicker. Since you left us no earthly remains... it is my sad duty to unveil this simple memorial. Next in our cavalcade of celebrity mourners- Bob Newhart. Uh- See, uh- To tell you the truth, I'm, uh- I was just- I'm just killing time here. I was waiting for a... well, a different- different funeral to start. I'll handle it. Bob Newhart, everybody! Oh, uh- Although, you know- Though I started my career... several years before Krusty, so... you know, I could never really have learned anything... directly from him... still, I think, in a way- in a very meaningful way- that, uh- that I- uh- uh- all of us- have, uh- have learned from him. You know, that is, by being, uh, on television for- for- for so many years. Even- Even though... you know, m-many of us, we- we didn't- we didn't watch his show. Th-Thank you. Well, that's the funeral, folks. We'll be sitting shivah at the Friar's Club at 7:00 p. m., and again at 10:00. You must be over 18 for the 10:00. It gets a little blue. And so, Herschel Krustofski... is gone, but not forgotten. Today was the unveiling of the new Krusty stamp. Postal patrons were asked to choose between two competing designs- one of Krusty's heartwarming smile... and one of his fiery death. By a nearly two-to-one vote, the smiling Krusty was chosen. Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time... just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night. Krusty! Mom! I just saw Krusty! Yes, dear, in your mind. No, on the street. On the street in your mind. Why won't you believe me? Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly... you think you see him everywhere. I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died. And these pills will help with the queasiness. Krusty? Dr. Hibbert, who was that man? Now, Bart, telling you... would violate the patient-doctor privilege... just as if I were to tell you that Jasper here has five seconds to live. What'd he say? He said I'm next. Am I going crazy? I'm seeing Krusty everywhere. Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere... because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. Would it help if I told you you're not responsible... for Krusty's death? Yes. Yes, it would. Well, I can't. You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem. Wait a minute. All those things I saw- there's a connection. The truck full of nets and buckets... the queasy guy, the lobsters- They all point to one thing. Follow me. Arr! I've got some customers. Call me back, Ishmael. Ahoy there, minnows. Ahoy. Have you seen this man? Arr! That's Handsome Pete. He dances for nickels. Pete, ye got some customers. No, we're looking for this man- Krusty the Clown. Hmm. N'arr, n'arr, n'arr. It's hopeless, Bart. We've searched up and down these docks... from pier one to that Pier I by pier 17. Lisa, look-a signature with stars around it, just like Krusty's. "Rory B. Bellows, slip eight." Let's go! Not a quarter! Arr! He'll be dancing for hours. Are you Rory B. Bellows? Yes. How about Krusty the Clown? Sorry. I don't do impressions. Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him? I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you... and I got a lot of corroborating evidence... over here... by the throttle! You know, you two could have said something... instead of letting me make an ass of myself. Hey, you got a pacemaker scar, just like Krusty. And Krusty's superfluous third nipple. Can't you see I don't want to be Krusty anymore? That's why I faked my death. But we saw your plane crash. Yeah, but I wasn't in it. Just before I hit the mountain, I jumped out of the plane... into a carefully placed net. Now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come back and do your show again. Or kill us. I won't be coming back, kids. I got a sweet life here. The sea air is clearing my lungs... the sun is toasting my pale skin a healthy brown... and most important, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All that high living just distracted me... from my true calling in life- salvaging sunken barges... for scrap iron. Sorry, kids. There's nothing left for me on dry land anymore. But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you... to brighten up their afternoons? Are you gonna turn your back on them? Yes! Come on, Lise. Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity. Yeah. Krusty doesn't want to be a clown. He's happy just being another blue-collar bozo. Meh! Krusty's tired of having phonies around... pretending to be his friends. I'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is. Uh, it could happen. Aw, who needs friends? The incessant beep of the global positioning system... is all the companionship I need. Tell me where you are now, you b*st*rd! All right, I admit it. I miss the phonies. That's all I miss- that and Shirley Jones's and Marty lngels's New Year's Eve party. What about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people? What about being an illiterate TV clown... who's still more respected than all the scientists... doctors and educators in the country put together? Yeah! I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect... while I'm out here on some stinkin' tub. That's just what those eggheads want. Well, forget it, poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town! Yea! So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problem? Don't sweat it. The life of Rory B. Bellows is insured... for a surprisingly large amount.
#07x16 - Lisa the Iconoclast^1796. A fiercely determined band of pioneers leaves Maryland... after misinterpreting a passage in the Bible. Their destination: New Sodom. This is their story. This is gonna be great. I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the lndians for corn... and then the lndians shot them and took the corn. Egad! A monster! It's a horrible fiend! It's some sort of land cow. Stand back, fellow settlers. Oh. Ye have saved our fledgling community. Mr. Springfield, how can I hope to achieve such greatness? A noble spirit "embiggens" the smallest man. Yea! Springfield rules! Way to go, Springfield! "Embiggens"? Hmm. I never heard that word before I moved to Springfield. I don't know why. It's a perfectly "cromulent" word. Now, as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial... just as memorable as our national bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that... with the possible exception of Kearney. Those tall ships really lifted the nation's spirits after Watergate. To celebrate our bicentennial, all 20 of you... will write an essay about Jebediah Springfield... and the best 18 will be put on file in the school library... available to anyone who requests them. Can we do illustrations? No. Hey. They need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look. I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier, an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge. What kind of apprentice? That's for my master to decide. How about town crier? You'd be great at that. You think so? Well, yeah, Dad. You're a big, fat loudmouth... and you can walk when you have to. Aw. Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot. Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb... but helped our founding fathers save on bridge tolls. Excuse me. I didn't mean to startle you, but I do love to talk Jebediah... even when I'm drinking my chicory. I'm the curator, Hollis Hurlbut. Hi. I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm here to research a report on Jebediah. Oh, you're in for a treat. You know, some historians consider Jebediah Springfield a minor patriot... but I think you'll find he's easily the equal... of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis. Congratulations, Ned. You are our new town crier. D'oh! May your shrill, nasal voice ring throughout our streets and brains. Well, thankily-dank, Mayor. I shan't disappoint. "Har" ye. "Har" ye. I declare myself pickled tink... about Springfield's bicen-citally... ti-tin-toodily, rin-tin-tennial day! You su-diddly-uck, Flanders! Give me that. Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye old town crier proclaimed crappy by all. Chooseth Homer Simpson, and he shalt rock thy world. Good God! He is fabulous. Mmm. He's "embiggened" that role with his "cromulent" performance. Top-notch "criering," I admit, but the hat and bell belong to Flanders. So no dice. Oh, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer taking my job and- Less chat, more hat. Whoo-hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer broadcasting system is on the air! All hollering, all the time. I'm gonna make- You're to restrict your criering to the parade... and selected preapproved publicity events. Okay. This case holds our most treasured exhibit: objects owned and used by Jebediah. Here's his fife, upon which he sounded the sweet note of freedom... his hatchet, with which he hacked at the chains of oppression... and his chamber pot. Wow. Excuse me. My microwave johnnycakes are ready. "The Secret Confessions of Jebediah Springfield"? "Know ye who read this, there is more to my life than history records." Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo. It was already tame. I merely shot it. Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah Springfield. Till 1796 I was Hans Sprungfeld, murderous pirate. And the half-wits of this town will never learn the truth. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" Oh, my God. Our town hero is a fraud. "I write this confession so that my infamy will live on... long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria." Ew. Here's johnnycakes. Is everything okay? You look a bit flushed. Oh, it's just the excitement of studying Jebediah. Sounds like you've come down with a serious case of"Jebeditis." Just when I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis. Did-You had arthritis? Um, no. Hear ye. Hear ye. What's for breakfast? Toast. I don't understand thee, Marge. Hmm. Ye olde toast. Whoo-hoo. What would you say if I told you that Jebediah Springfield... wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? Look. Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans Sprungfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog-house fight. No tongue, eh? How did he talk- and eat and laugh and love? He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver. Yes. That'd do. He was one of the evilest men of the 1780s. He even tried to kill George Washington. The dastard! Give me all your money. Never! Ooh! Aaah! I got the white stars you wanted, but I couldn't find... any red hearts, yellow moons or green clovers. Well, I'll use it, but I'm not paying for it. The next time Hans Sprungfeld was seen... he had changed his name to Jebediah Springfield. Lisa, honey. When my family first came to this state... they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story. I believe you, honey. You do? Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing... and for once I want in on the ground floor. Oh, thanks, Dad. Ralph. "A." Janey. "A." And, Lisa, for your- essay... "Jebediah Springfield: Super-Fraud," "F." But it's all true. This is nothing but... dead-white-male bashing from a P.C. thug. It's women like you who keep the rest of us from landing a husband. Well, nice talking to ya. Lisa? Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up. She called me a P.C. thug. Well, I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: Grease ourselves up real good and trash that place with a baseball bat. That won't help, Dad. No one's ever gonna believe me. But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife. We could? Come on. We can use the baseball bat to smash open the case. No baseball bat. Oh. Hi, Mr. Hurlbut. Oh, you're back. And you brought a friend. Town crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: Where's the fife? And two: Give me the fife. Hey! Stop! I've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier... but this is well outside your jurisdiction. Oh, yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it. What the- That's Jebediah's secret confession. It proves he was a fraud. "The Secret Confessions of Jebediah Springfield." Oh. I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious forgery. Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by this sort of hoax. The so-called confession... is just as phony as the Howard Hughes will... the Hitler diaries or the Emancipation Retraction. But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah before 1795. He was Hans Sprungfeld until then. That's preposterous. Now get out. You're banned from this historical society. You and your children and your children's children. For three months. I'm not gonna give up. I refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth. I'd like 25 copies on goldenrod- Right. um, 25 on canary- Canary. 25 on saffron- Mm-hmm. and 25 on paella. Okay. 100 yellow. You don't have to help me with this, Dad. Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helpin' the little guy. And you're the littlest guy I know. Question. Is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron? No. It's Homer. Then I will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, Homer. And if I see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties... I will know that you stole my idea. I'm just waitin' for my kid. Mental note. Steal his idea. Hi, Apu. Can I put this poster in your window? Well, of course you can, you little pixie. Oh. You're just as sweet as the sticks which bear your name. No, no. No, no. No, no, no. Take that down. As a semi-legal immigrant, your poster could land me in a predicament... as red hot as the candies which bear that name. He wouldn't let me put it up. Okay. Well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention. Hear ye! Hear ye! My daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield. Aw, the little cutie wants to do somethin' cute. Shut up, ya bums! Shut up! Go ahead, angel. Jebediah Springfield was nothing more... than an evil bloodthirsty pirate who hated this town. Good God! Homer, you know, I support, uh, most any prejudice you can name... but your hero phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit. There's an exit? "Evil bloodthirsty pirate. " Hello. Town Jubilation Committee? Yeah. I got something that's gonna make you a lot less jubilant. Can't you understand, little girl? Jebediah was no criminal. That's right. The reason they say he had a silver tongue... is because he was such a fine speaker. That's a myth that got mixed up with the truth. You are tampering with forces you can't understand. We have major corporations sponsoring this event. I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate. A pirate? Well, that's hardly the image we want for Long John Silver's. Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our bicentennial. There is one way. Get the silver tongue. If Jebediah's who I say he is, then it should still be in his grave. Why, that's highly unorthodox. Yes, but human decency prevents- Dig him up! Dig up that corpse! If you really love Jebediah Springfield... you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong. Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue! Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end with us digging up a corpse? Now, Lisa, when you see there's no silver tongue in there... will you stop trying to ruin Jebediah's reputation? Yes. What do we win if the tongue is there? Credibility. Aw. What a gyp. Jebediah Springfield has been replaced with a skeleton! No. That's the skeleton of Jebediah. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Uh, well, let's start looking for that silver tongue. Don't forget to look in his shoes. When I lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes. Actually, if it's anywhere it would be lodged in the sinus. All right. Here goes. Forgive us, Jebediah. We mean no disrespect. Well, that settles that. There is no silver tongue, is there, Bonesy? Oh, I wish, Chief. With that kind of dough, I could buy me some eyeballs. Well, that's the spirit, Bonesy. Why don't you sing a song for the nice people? All right. I was so sure. Hear ye. Hear ye. Everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home. Not so fast, Simpson. This foul business was all your fault. By the power vested in me, I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell- No! No! and tri-corner hat. You will have the hat cleaned and then return it. Oh, Dad. I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade. Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away. Why did you dig up the bones of the past? Why did you disturb the ghosts of history? I- I- General Washington? You did some good work exposing Jebediah, Lisa. Don't stop now. There's just one piece left in the puzzle. But I've caused so much trouble already, General Washington. I can't go on. We had quitters in the Revolution too. We called them Kentuckians. Well, I'll just have to find another little girl to be president. What's your friend Janey's number? No! Not Janey! She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys! Oh, let me help you, George Washington. I still want to help you! I want to help you, George Washington? Even your dreams are square. Can you open my milk, Mommy? I'm not Mommy, Ralph. I'm Miss Hoover. The missing piece of the puzzle. I've got it.! You? What are you doing here? I was right about Jebediah, and now I can prove it. Oh, please. Not that claptrap again. Haven't you hurt Jebediah enough with your childish tales... of pirate ships and fisticuffs and a silver tongue that can't be found? That's because you stole it! That's a lie! I'm an antiquarian, damn it. It's my job to seek out the truth. But when you found the truth you couldn't take it. You couldn't stand that you devoted your life to a fraud... so you covered it up, didn't you? Didn't you? No. No. That-That's preposterous. I mean, I- I couldn't. You-You can't- Stop it! Where's the silver tongue? I thought no one would ever find it. When I pried open the coffin it was there- that shiny tongue sticking out of his mouth... razzing my entire career- my-my life. Before the dust could settle, I pocketed it. But I thought I had you fooled. You did. Until I realized that Jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to. How else could he have gotten this? Sprungfeld must have taken it with him when he ran off after the fight. Exactly. This celebration is a sham. And it's all my fault. We've got to get the word out to every man, woman and child in town. Stop! Stop everything! Stop the parade. What? What's goin' on here? This is highly unorthodox. This is Lisa Simpson. She's discovered something very important... about Jebediah Springfield that you need to hear. People of Springfield, I, um- I don't know quite how to say this- Don't be shy, little girl. Think of Jebediah, and the words will come. I did a lot of research on Jebediah Springfield, and- Hmm. I think I can pick her off. Wait. Let's see what she has to say. Jebediah Springfield was- Jebediah was... great. I, um, just wanted to say... that I've done some research, and, uh... he was great. Yeah. Well said. Great speech! Jebediah would be proud of you. Why didn't you tell them? Because the myth of Jebediah has value too. It's brought out the best in everyone in this town. Regardless of who said it, a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man. Well, hey. It's Homer. Good to see you, nei- Get lost. Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! He is not the official town crier! Police, do something! Well, I'd like to, ma'am, but he's too damn good. Let him march, boys. Let the man march. It's that team of Jebediah Springfield. Whip them horses Let them wagons roll. That a people might embiggen America. That a man might embiggen. His soul. His soul. Hyah. His soul. Hyah.! Hyah.
#07x17 - Homer the Smithers^Testing. Testing for Mr. Burns. Here you go, sir. I've warmed up the crowd for you. "Welcome, employees." "Come in." "The whole night's entertainment is on me." "Monty Burns." Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! To an evening of exciting quarter-mile action.! Action.! Action.! Our first race is a benefit for daredevil Lance Murdock.! Murdock.! Murdock.! Who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver! Liver! Liver! All right! Liver! It sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? I'd be a real hotrod mama, wouldn't I? Huh? Huh? You missed the race, Mama. Hmm. I wish I'd pay more attention. Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or funkier. I'll switch to the tablespoon, sir. Coming up next.! Our feature race- the Nuclear Power Plant Championship! Plant! Plant! Ah! At last. Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars. Damnation! Tell them to go slower. Yes, sir. Hi, guys. Could we keep it in first gear for a couple laps? Go.! Go.! Slow down. Excellent. This novelty foam hand is ludicrously oversized. Go swap it for a smaller one. It is a bit ostentatious, sir. I'll be right back. Hey, Burnsie! This was some swell shindig. Thank you very much. Smithers! What's happening? I had a great time. I just wanna shake your hand. You're the greatest. Smithers! Help! Doesn't seem as funny to me. But what do I know? Smithers.! Oh, my God! Hey-hey! You should've seen the murderous glint in his eyes, Smithers. And his breath reeked of beer and pretzled bread. I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault. No. Don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly, I always had my mace. Don't let me off the hook that easily, sir. I failed you, and I'll never forgive myself. Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Good morning, sir. To make up for my failure last night... I've alphabetized your breakfast. You can start with the waffles and work your way up to the zwieback. And to prevent newsprint from rubbing off on your hands... I've laminated today's newspaper. I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How am I supposed to do the "Junior Jumble"? Oh! I can't even grovel properly. I'm a buffoon. I don't deserve to live on your planet anymore! Agh! Pull yourself together, man. I daresay you're in need of a long vacation. No! Don't make me take a vacation. Without you, I'll wither and die! That's a risk I'm willing to take. What would you do without me? I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me. You see? Now, I insist you take a vacation... just as soon as a temporary substitute can be found. Sheesh.! I've got to find a replacement who won't outshine me. Perhaps if I search the employee evaluations for the word "incompetent." 714 names? Better be more specific. Lazy. Clumsy. Dimwitted. Monstrously ugly. Nuts to this. I'll just go get Homer Simpson. I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around. You know, Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm. You know, Homer, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm. Mom, I just said that. Sor-ry. Next time, get your own darn corn. Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on? Yeah. Now, I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job... but actually it's just 2,800 small jobs. Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right? Your new duties will include answering Mr. Burns's phone... preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs... assisting with his chewing and swallowing... lying to Congress and some light typing. Montgomery Burns's office. Oh, hello, Mrs. Burns. I'll see if your son is available. Mr. Burns has a mother? She must be a hundred million years old. She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell. I'm sorry. Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a very important meeting and can't be disturbed. Uh-huh. Okay, I'll give him the message. Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for having that affair with President Taft. Taft, you old dog. Really, Smithers, I'll be fine. I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he anyway? Uh, Homer Simpson, sir. One of your organ banks from Sector 7G. All the recent events of your life... have revolved around him in some way. Simpson, eh? Uh, Mr. Smithers.! I don't understand 2,700 of my new duties. Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty is giving you the most trouble? Um, what do I do in case of fire? Sorry. Can't hear you. Bye. Aw! Just my luck. Good Lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation. Smithers already left, sir. I'm his replacement- Homer Simpson. Ah, yes. Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat... some steamed toast and a dodo egg. But I think the dodo went extinct- Get going! And answer those phones, install the computer system... and rotate my office so the window faces the hills. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff... where you said all about the... things? Uh, the things? Lousy two-legged pants. Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. Little rascals isn't on till 6:00. I'm taping it. I wanna get to Mr. Burns's house bright and early to make his breakfast. Oh, poor Homie. Poor, poor- Hmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker. Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast... and I'm gonna cook the best damn breakfast he ever ate. Hmm. Hmm. Doughnuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food. Here. Tell me how my stocks did yesterday. Uh, they all won. Hmm? What about my options? Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep. I believe I'll get up. Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off. I think... the fangs today. Simpson? Simpson. Did you get that report on the accounting department? Yes, sir, I did. "The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9:00 a. m. to 5:00 p. m." The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone. Here are your messages. "You have 30 minutes to move your car." "You have 10 minutes." "Your car has been impounded." "Your car has been crushed into a cube." "You have 30 minutes to move your cube." Y'ello. Mr. Burns's office. Is it about my cube? It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you. How's everything going there, sir? Heh. I have a lot of free time on my hands. If you FedEx me your mail, I'd be happy to open it and return it to you. Everything's fine, Smithers. This Simpson fellow seems to be getting dumber by the minute. I've never seen anything quite like it. Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation. Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick. Yes! Yes, sir! Get cracking on my long division, and don't forget to show your work, Simpson. I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir. Bart! Leave Simpson alone. Simpson, I need a ride to the library. Yes, sir. Kids! Stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax? No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division. Simpson! Lie down! Sorry, but you need a good night's rest. Simpson.! The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it. Y'ello. It's for you. "Relax"] Mr. Burns- 48 rings. Are you all right? What did Simpson do to you? Do? Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything. A complete moron. But I'm not really free to talk right now. Look. Stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back. Uh, actually, sir, picture taking is not allowed at this particular resort. Oop. I gotta go now. There's a line forming behind me. Sixty watts? What do you think this is, a tanning salon? I asked for light starch on my nightcap! You call this Postum? You call this a tax return? You call this a supercomputer? D'egh! G'yah! D'oh! You're a travesty of a f- joke of an assistant! Is there something wrong, Homie? No. Except- Except... I killed Mr. Burns! What happened, Dad? I punched Burns right in his 104-year-old face. Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really, really hurt him. Okay. Maybe everything's all right. Maybe, if you go apologize, he won't even fire you... if he's alive. Mr. Burns? I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here. Let me put some salt on that eye. No! Please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be. Yes, sir. Must... call... Smithers. He'll protect me from this beast. I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't seem to be any trick to it. Let's see. Smithers. S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S. Success! It's ringing. Moe's Tavern. I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers, first name Waylon. Oh. So you're lookin' for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you! When I catch you, I'm gonna pull out your eyes and shove 'em down your pants... so you can watch me kick the crap outta you! Okay? Then I'm gonna use your tongue to paint my boat. Ooh. Oh, Smithers, if only you could hear me. Something tells me Mr. Burns needs me. Something tells me Mr. Burns needs me. Praise God. That thug has finally gone home for the day. Now I can make my escape. Hi, Mr. Burns. You want your coffee now? No. I'm, uh, making it myself. Hear that? The percolations are imminent. No need to come in. Cease your ingress. Stay back, Homer. Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself. Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's 5:00. No! I thought- I thought I'd chauffeur myself this evening. Yes. That's what I thought. How difficult can it be? I'm sure the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator... and which the deceleratrix, hmm? I can't believe it. All my life, I've avoided doing things for myself. But I'm actually enjoying this. Plus I'm making incredible time. Beep-beep! Out of my way! I'm a motorist. Uh, that's some nice reckless drivin', Mr. B. Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir? Already taken care of. Cappuccino, Simpson? Ahoy! Ahoy! No, you have the wrong number. This is 5246. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy. Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you? No, Homer. You've already done more for me than any man. Your brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that being waited on hand and foot is okay for your average joe. But it's not for me. I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God! I knew I shouldn't have left. Ah! Welcome back, Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang-up job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in Sector 7G. You heard the man, Simpson. Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers. You're no longer needed at all. You're fired. Ta. You shouldn't have gone away on vacation. Cheer up, Homie. I feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge... if you got fired from the- those things that... you do. Quick, Mom. Whip up a cake before Dad fires ya. Don't worry, Dad. Mr. Smithers is a resilient man. I'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants. Meet your new piano mover. We're gonna have to put a steel rod where your spine was. Will I ever move a piano again? Oh, my goodness gracious! No. Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action... at the Springfield Drag Strip! It'll be motorized mayhem! Mayhem! Mayhem! Do we need all those "mayhems"? We do. All right. Fair enough. I suppose you know your business. Get ready for fun! Fun! Fun! Uh, people are already here. We don't need to keep hustling them like this, do we? Will you let go of me? Where are you throwing me? Uh, hello. Is that a "Help Wanted" sign in the window? Uh, yeah. I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely off the truck. I'll just wait out back until then. I look forward to workin' with ya. Mr. Smithers! Wait! You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices. You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job- like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments- or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy... and do whatever it takes to get them back! You're right! But I'm gonna need your help. Oh, my God! Beer delivery. Sign here. No.! It's you.! Oh, boy.! Gimme that.! Okay. I gotcha covered. Mr. Burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties... but I'll wager dollars to doughnuts... he still can't handle a call from his mother. You're on! What? Hello. Mrs. Burns. This is Waylon Smithers. I have your son, Montgomery, on the line. That improvident lackwit! Always too busy stridin' about his atom mill to call his own mother. I'll give him what for till he cries brassafrax! Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him, I'll rush in and save the day. Got it. I'm transferring a call in to you, Mr. Burns. No problemo. Uh, ooh. Um. Uh-oh. Ahoy, ahoy. Ahoy. Hello. Mr. Burns? This is your mother. No! Oh, hello, Mater. Um, sorry about pulling the plug on you and all. Who could have known you'd pull through and... live for another five decades. Ooh! Is my face red. Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. And she doesn't call her son "Mr. Burns." Son, this is Mrs. Burns. I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel- So. Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers, you must have put him up to it. I'm glad I fired you. You really blew it this time, Smithers. Stop that! Stop that at once! You're fighting! Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson! Okay. Stop it.! Stop it, I say.! I'll teach you how to use a phone, you boob! Ring! Ring! Ring! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! It's for you. D'oh! I'll show you! Oh, my. Here comes the endangered condor into the power lines. Mm. Mm. Mm. I've got Bobo, hot from the dryer. Careful not to burn yourself on his eye. I don't need you to do any of this. I'm totally self-reliant now. What I would like, though, is a spanish peanut. Skin. Mm-mmm-mmm! It's a remarkable thing. In the short time you were gone... I learned to be completely self-reli- ant. Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the window... see that he gets what's coming to him. I already have, sir. What'd you get that for? For knocking Mr. Burns out of a third-story window. Makes sense to me. Did he die? What am I, a doctor?
#07x18 - The Day the Violence Died^We now return to our 48-hour Itchy & Scratchy diamond jubilee marathon- celebrating 75 years of rib-tickling brutality... and hilarious atrocities.[/i] The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Aw. If I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me. Will do. Tonight: A stowaway bear is terrorizing space shuttle astronauts. But first a sneak peak at tomorrow's Itchy and Scratchy parade. Hello, everybody. I'm here live on Main Street... where dedicated fans are already staking out the best seats for the big anniversary parade. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye, kids. On your way back pick up a six-pack ofbeer. Bart, Lisa, it's 11:00 at night. Where do you think you're going? Downtown. We gotta get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade. I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. Homer, you go too. Oh! Why can't they just take the gun? Hey, the comic book store's still open. Save our seats. Will do. Hello. Oh! Hey, sister, just give me a chance to get next to you. Hey-y-y! Hey, my threads, baby. How come I've never seen that Itchy & Scratchy before? Perhaps because you are a prepubescent ignoramus. This is a bootleg copy of Itchy & Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat. Because of its frank depiction of s*x and narcotic consumption... it is not for infantile intellects such as yours. Now toodle-oo. Cool. I'll give you 10 bucks for that. Are you the creator of Hi and Lois? Because you are making me laugh. That drawing is worth exactly $750 American. It's valuable, huh? Ooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional. I simply can't allow you to waste them here... when there are so many crimes going unsolved at this very moment. Go! Go, for the good of the city. Loser. Oh, nerts! Which one's Itchy- the car? The mouse. Oh. I guess that's not him then. Represented on this next float is Roger Myers Sr... who founded his company in 1921... and struck it big when he teamed up a mouse named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy. Here we see him creating the two comical characters... out of thoughts he plucks from his head. And that man waving from the front of the float... is his son, Roger Myers Jr. Oh, isn't this just the most fun you've ever had in your life, Dave? Yes, Suzanne. It is. Whoa! Whoa! Oh, forget this. I'm outta here. Yea, Bart.! Yea.! And now the parade has entered Bumtown.! Oh, it's all just so exciting, Dave.! Certainly seems to be a poorly planned parade route. Uh-oh. Hey, wait up! Get outta Bumtown, ya no-talent bum! Show some respect, man. That "no-talent" created Itchy and Scratchy. He didn't create Itchy. I did. Huh? He stole the character from me in 1928. When I complained, his thugs kicked me out of his office and dropped an anvil on me. Luckily I was carrying an umbrella at the time. You invented Itchy- the Itchy & Scratchy Itchy? Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon violence. Before I came along, all cartoon animals did was play the ukulele. I changed all that. Well, I'm not callin' you a liar, but- but I can't think of a way to finish that sentence. So I'm a liar, am I? "Itchy the Lucky Mouse in Manhattan Madness. " That's the first Itchy cartoon ever made. And it was made by me, ChesterJ. Lampwick. Find me a 90-year-old projector and I'll prove it to you. "Itchy runs afoul of an lrishman." Look out, Itchy.! He's lrish.! Come on, Itchy. Kill him.! Kill that guy.! "A chance for more mis"- Look at that fat oaf. Shh.! That's Teddy Roosevelt. All right, Chester.! Woo.! Way to go.! I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right. You did invent him. When people see this, you'll be rich and famous. D'oh. That was a nice film I had once. Last time I try to impress a four-year-old. Well, see ya, kid. You can't just go back to the gutter. You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire. Ah, Roger Myers wouldn't give me a cent in the '20s. Why would he give me anything now? You asked Roger Myers Sr. for money. Roger Myers Jr. 's in charge of the studio now. He's a good man. Every Christmas he goes down to the pound... and rescues one cat and one mouse and gives them to a hungry family. Hmm, studio's closed until Tuesday. Animators have A.A. on Monday. Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents won't mind because they won't even know about it. All right. The coast is clear. There's a box you can sleep in. Thanks. Just move that cot outta the way. Okay. Do you know what radon is? No. Good night. Spare change? Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing... coming from the basement, and Dad's upstairs. Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger. He's not a regular bum, Mom. He's a genius bum. He created Itchy, and he's the father of cartoon violence. He just needs to stay here till tomorrow. We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios to pick up his check. We're goin' down to Itchy & Scratchy Studios to pick up his check. Well, if it's just for one more night. So, let's review: You two screwballs have just strolled in here fresh from the sewer... and given me a bunch of bulldink about creating Itchy-with no proof at all- and you expect me to give you... how much? $800 billion. Well, that brought back a lot of memories. All right, gentlemen, I'll take your case. But I'm going to have to ask for a thousand-dollar retainer. A thousand dollars? But your ad says, "No money down." Oh, they got this all screwed up. So you don't work on a contingency basis? No, money down! Oops. I shouldn't have this Bar Association logo here either. Hey, Dad, can I have a thousand dollars? All right. Wait. For what? To pay for a lawyer for my bum. Forget it. I thought I recognized you. I gave you a plate of corn muffins back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop. And you never did it! Those corn muffins were lousy. Paint my chicken coop! Make me! That does it. One of them has to go. Okay. Grandpa. No, the B-U-M. Oh. Wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester... without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter. And all it will cost you is a thousand dollars. Exhibit A: Steamboat Itchy, dated 1928. The very first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. And the credits clearly state... "Written, directed and created by Roger Myers. "Music by Roger Myers and George Gershwin. "Produced by Roger Myers and Joseph P. Kennedy. Copyright 1928 by Roger Myers. " You will also notice Mr. Myers's name and copyright notice... on the original drawings of the other members of the Itchy and Scratchy family: Brown-Nose Bear, Disgruntled Goat... Flatulent Fox, Rich Uncle Skeleton... and Dinner Dog. My client's film predates all of those things, Your Honor. Oh, yes! I've forgotten... your famous film- the one you destroyed before the trial and haven't been able to find another copy of. Oh, yes. That film. Yes. You don't have a copy, do you? Krusty, have you ever seen this so-called animation genius before? Yes, I have. You have? I gave him a couple of blintzes to paint my fence... but he never did it! Those blintzes were terrible. Paint my fence! Make me. You give me back those blintzes then! Order! Order! We don't care about your blintzes. Now, Mr. Lampwick, when Roger Myers stole your character- Objection. Sustained. If I hear "objection" and "sustained"... one more time today, I think I'm going to scream. Objection. Sustained. Roger Myers didn't create any of his characters. He stole them all. Stole them all? That could turn this whole case around. The only characters Myers could ever come up with were pathetic stick figures... with the words "Sarcastic Horse" and "Manic Mailman" printed on 'em. And they stank! So he started stealing other people's characters. That's a lie! Are you saying- under oath, Mr. Myers- that your father didn't steal any of the characters associated with your studio? Well, I don't think I am under oath, but yes, my father created them all. Except for Flatulent Fox. That was based on a true story. But he did create Itchy. That's one thing I am sure of. Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours. Do you have any evidence at all? Well, Your Honor, we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture. Those are... kinds of evidence. Your Honor, I move for dismissal. I've got it! Dad, give me $750. Okay. Keep the trial going. I'll be right back. Your Honor, I'd like to call all of my surprise witnesses again. Oh, there they are. Oh, they were my favorites. Thank you. I knew I had seen this exact scene somewhere else. It was in the movie Mr. Lampwick showed me. Ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919- nine years before Roger Myers made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. That could have been drawn by anyone at anytime, Your Honor. There's no signature or date. Look under the frame, Brad. Careful. Careful. Whoops. It's there! Hmm. "To Roger Myers. Keep drawing. "Your moxie more than makes up for your lack of talent. Your pal, ChesterJ. Lampwick. September 3, 1919." Okay. Maybe my dad did steal Itchy. But so what? Animation is built on plagiarism. If it weren't for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners... we wouldn't have The Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there'd be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound? Chief Wiggum? Yogi Bear? Ha! Andy Griffith. Edward G. Robinson. Art Carney. Your Honor, you take away our right to steal ideas... where are they gonna come from- her? Uh- hmm- How 'bout... Ghost Mutt? The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick. Itchy & Scratchy Studios will pay a restitution of $800 billion. Though that amount will probably come down a bit on appeal. I hope you're happy, kid. The studio's bankrupt. You just killed Itchy and Scratchy. We killed Itchy and Scratchy? Good riddance. Wanna go celebrate? I feel like liver and onions. Mmm. What are you gonna do with all your money, Mr. Lampwick? Well, first off, here's your thousand dollars back for hiring that lawyer... and $750 for the drawing... and here's a couple of bucks for your trouble. Whoo-hoo! Look, Marge. A couple of bucks! As for the rest of it, I'm gonna buy the one thing I've been dreaming of... all the years I spent in the gutter: a solid gold house. Well, Itchy and Scratchy are gone, but here's a cartoon that tries to make learning fun! Heh-heh-ho-ho- Sorry about this, kids. But stay tuned. We got some real good toy commercials comin' right up. I swear. Hey, who left all this garbage on the steps of Congress? I'm not garbage. I'm an amendment to be Yes, an amendment to be. And I'm hopin' that they'll ratify me There's a lot offlag burners. Who have got too much freedom. I wanna make it legal for policemen to beat 'em 'Cause there's limits to our liberties. Least I hope and pray that there are 'Cause those liberal freaks go too far. But why can't we just make a law against flag burning? Because that law would be unconstitutional. But if we change the Constitution- Then we could make all sorts of crazy laws.! Now you're catching on. What the hell is this? It's one of those campy, '70s throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers. We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little. What if people say you're not good enough to be in the Constitution? Then I'll crush all opposition to me. And I'll make Ted Kennedy pay. If he fights back I'll say that he's gay. Good news, Amendment. They ratified ya. You're in the U.S. Constitution. Oh, yeah! Door's open, boys. Whoob-whoob-whoob-whoob. So it's true. Some cartoons do encourage violence. Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back. And soon! Ow! You've got to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons. The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties. Royalties? Ha! I don't have the money to produce the cartoons. I lost everything. I can't even keep my dad's head in the freakin' cryogenic center anymore. Ya comfortable in there, Daddy? Look, if money's the only problem, I know a guy who has lots of it. Shoe shine, sir? Comb your hair for ya? Sir? Humph. Sir? Sir? Sir? Okay. Catch you on the way back. Oh, hi, kids. Hi, Chester. Listen. Would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons? You'll get more royalties. I don't need any more money. I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my health and my millions of dollars... and my gold house and my rocket car... I don't need anything else. Yes, but- Not interested. Dad, can we have $183,000? What for? Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons. Oh. Uh- Forget it! Oh, no. I give up. There's nothin' we can do. Yeah. I agree. You wanna start on tryin' to get Apu out of jail? Okay. Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy. You're always so good at these things. Why, together you've reunited Krusty with his father... gotten Principal Skinner his job back... and helped Dr. Riviera perform open heart surgery on your father. You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius. You're right, Mom. I'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too. Bart, look at this! What a perfect plan. Now Roger Myers's hotel is just- And, so, when no one could think of a plan to resurrect Itchy and Scratchy... a young boy- a wonderful, irrepressible young boy- took it on his own to solve the problem. He discovered that the Postal Service's Mr. Zip... was just a rip-off of my father's stick figure character Manic Mailman. So the government gave me a huge cash settlement... and Itchy & Scratchy Studios is back in business. Thanks to you, Lester. What the hell is going on? I don't know. But it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden. Thanks, everybody. But I couldn't have done all this... without the help of my brainy sister, Eliza. I, too, owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza. This is a great vindication for anybody who was ever taking a bath... went to get the paper, fell down and had the door slam behind them and the doorknob break off. And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife. I never even heard about that. I don't understand it. We're always the ones who solve these problems. I guess you don't need it now, but... we had a plan too. Hey, great. Listen. Write it down and mail it to last week, when I might have cared. I've got cartoons to make, kids. And Scratchy Show Huh? You kids must be so happy. Your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air. Yes. Well, technically everything worked out all right, but- But? Well, I wasn't the one who solved the problem... and neither was Lisa. There's something unsettling about that.
#07x19 - A Fish Called Selma^Movie For A Rained-Out Ballgame now returns... to Dyan Cannon, Troy McClure and the Muppets... in the 1977 film... The Muppets Go Medieval. Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in marriage? Oh, Sir Liesalot, I will! Mmm. Unhand the swine, you swain. Come, Piggy. Back to Hamelot. Not now, frog. Me and lron-Pants are just getting acquainted. Dad, what's a "Muppet?" Well, it's not quite a mop and it's not quite a puppet, but, man- So, to answer your question, I don't know. Parry. Why'd they make that one Muppet out ofleather? That's not a leather Muppet. That's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob. Yeah. Who'd have thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo? What are you talking about? You know, his bizarre personal life. Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium. Why, I heard- Oh, Homer! That's just an urban legend. People don't do that type of thing with fish. Troy McClure's a perfect gentleman, like Bing Crosby orJ.F.K. I wonder where Troy is now. Uh-oh. Oh. Oh. Hey, these guys are all over the road.! All right, Captain Rush-Rush. Out of the car. Oh, I'm seeing stars here! No, just one. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such films as The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed... and They Came to Burgle Carnegie Hall. Uh, afraid not. License, please. It says here you need corrective lenses. Put those glasses on, mister. You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses! It'd be a crime against nature! Well, they do kind of make you look like a nerd. Tell you what. Just go down to the D.M.V. tomorrow and try to pass that eye test. I'll tear up this ticket, but I'm still gonna have to ask you for a bribe. Hello, Marge. Hello, Marge. How come no Chippendales dancers... ever come in to renew their licenses? They carpool. That's the problem. Hey, I came here to get this revoked! Troy McClure? I thought he disappeared after that scandal at the aquarium. Hey, I thought you said Troy McClure was dead! No. What I said was he sleeps with the fishes. You see- Uh, Tony, please! No. I just ate a whole plate of"dingamagoo." Oh! Troy McClure! Hello, beautiful. John Law tells me I might need to wear these glasses. You? Nonsense. You're Troy McClure. I remember you from such films as Meet Joe Blow... and Give My Remains to Broadway. Stars like you don't need glasses. Yuck! Now, Mr. McClure, would you like to take off those glasses... and read the top line? Uh, W... seven, star, pound. Look, Miss... "Boo-Veer." As an actor, I depend on my remarkable looks. If you could find it in your heart to pass me... I'm sure I could find some way to repay you. Say by buying you dinner? That took a lot of class. All these celebrities on the walls. I just know a big star like you is up there somewhere. Uh, yes. I'm over there. Hmm? Hmm. Hmm. Mm-mmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh.! So, working at the D.M.V. must be very interesting. Well, I think I'm getting Repetitive Stress Disorder... from scratching my butt all day. Being a huge movie star must be good too. What are you working on now? I've been reading a lot of scripts lately. You know, it's a lot cheaper than going to the movies. Well, thanks for holding up your end of the bargain. I had a pretty good time. Yeah. Me too. You need a ride somewhere? Hey, get a load of this! Troy McClure on what looks like a date! Here you go, boys. A little something for page one. Hey, Homer.! Isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy McClure? Troy McClure. He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels. Oh, I don't know. Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish weren't true after all. This changes everything. I'd pay to see him in a movie now. If only that were possible. Troy! My man! It's MacArthur Parker! MacArthur Parker, the agent? MacArthur Parker, my agent? Just checking in, my friend. So, how's my favorite client? We haven't spoken in eight years. Yes. So, I saw the papers today, Troy. Looking good. That wholesome stuff really helps when I'm trying to find you work. You haven't found me work in 12 years. Oh, you! Jury duty is work. And, listen, you keep getting seen in public with human females... and I can get you work in the entertainment industry. Hey.! Hello. Selma Bouvier? It's Troy McClure. You may remember me from such dates as last night's dinner. Hey! Troy! Troy! That's right, boys. Troy's back from the gutter, and he's brought someone with him! That's too funny! I can't remember when I've heard a funnier anecdote! Okay, now you tell one. Well, not much happens to me... but I once had dinner with a movie star... and it was the most wonderful night of my life. Really? Who was it? George Segal? I hear he plays the banjo. Hmm, yeah. Excuse me. I ordered a Zima, not "emphysema." Please, don't smoke in our restaurant. We don't serve contemporary California cuisine in your lungs. Troy, uh, I'm sorry I ruined our evening. I have to go now. Oh, my God! Oh, God! I'm such a fool. Got a light? Oh. Sounds like you're really falling for him. What's the matter? I'm not fun enough for you? Patty! Go on, Selma. Tell me more. I don't want to jinx it, Marge, but this could be it. He asked me out again this Friday. He's taking me to a special screening of his latest film. You know, smoke actually smells good when it's coming outta you. Oh, I'm all out. Here. Try one of my cigars. Mmm. My God! It's like five cigarettes at once! Oh, my head is swimming! That's not cigars, baby. That's love. No longer canst I conceal my love, my wimpled turtledove. Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in marriage? Oh, Troy! Oh, Sir Liesalot.! I will! Ohh! Just a second, baby. Tonight, '70s leading man Troy McClure has finally met the woman of his dreams. We may remember- Woman? Huh. Okay. We may remember Troy from such films... as The Verdict Was Mail Fraud and Leper in the Backfield. With his high-profile romance... Troy's managed to shake the rumors that have dogged his career. And with news of his upcoming wedding, rumor has it he's up for some very choice roles. Looks like you were wrong when you called him a washed-up deviant, Laurie. All right. Make sure my iguana's okay. Selma, Jub Jub is fantastic! He's everywhere you want to be. Welcome to your new home, baby. It's fantastic! Garbage collection is Monday. If you want to throw out a box, you have to cut it up. It's so modern. It's ultramodern, like living in the not-too-distant future. Now, you make yourself at home here. I'll be sleeping downstairs in the visitor's center. Oh. Okay. I'll see you in the morning, and get ready for tennis. It comes on at 10:00. Troy, Mac Parker. Ever hear of Planet of the Apes? Uh, the movie or the planet? The brand-new, multi-million-dollar musical! And you are starring... as the human. It's the part I was born to play, baby! Help. The human's about to escape. Get your paws off me, you dirty ape! He can talk! He can talk. He can talk. He can talk! He can talk! He can talk.! He can talk.! I can sing. Ooh! Help me, Dr. Zaius! Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius Oh, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. What's wrong with me. I think you're crazy. Want a second opinion. You're also lazy. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius, oh, Dr. Zaius. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. Can I play the piano anymore. Of course you can. Well, I couldn't before Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius. This play has everything. Oh, I love legitimate theater. Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius I hate every ape I see. From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z No, you'll never make a monkey. Out of me. Oh, my God, I was wrong. It was Earth all along. You finally made a monkey. Yes, we finally made a monkey. Yes, you finally. Made a monkey. Out of me. I love you, Dr. Zaius. Thank you. It's great to be back. I just want to say I wouldn't be here without the support of a very special lady- my always outrageous fiancée, Selma. Take a bow, sugar beet. Oh. Well. Thank you. Down in front! My good looks paid for that pool... and my talent filled it with water. Hi, I'm Troy McClure, your future uncle. Hi. I remember you from such filmstrips... as locker room towel fight: The Blinding of Larry Driscoll. I was one of the first to speak out against horseplay. Uh-huh. Remember when we were kids, we used to dream about our ideal husbands? Who knew the dream would come true for one of us? Oh, come on! Guess which one. I know. I know. It's Selma, right? Yeah, that's a good idea, Homer... but they've already made some movies about World War II. Aw, hell! Well, what about Dracula? Homer, I'm really touched you invited me out on the town. You're gonna be a four-star brother-in-law. Troy, buddy, I got to know. What's a great guy like you want to marry a guy like Selma? Come here, Homer. Okay. I'll let you in on a little secret. And do you, Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Bouvier... take the fabulous Troy McClure to be your lawful wedded husband? I already told you yes. If anyone here knows why this couple should not be wed in holy matrimony... let him speak now or forever hold his peace. Da-da da-da-da Hey! Da-da-da-da, da-da da-da-da Hey! Da-da. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss... each other. This is the best day of my life. It's a good day for me too, baby. Now, smile. We're gonna be on every newsstand in the country. Mwah! Hey! Look what I snagged, Marge. The candy bride and groom from the wedding cake. Mmm. Pointy. It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier. That reminds me-Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently, he doesn't really love Selma... and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle. What? Oh, my God! Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep. There. This better be important. It's my wedding night. I'm trying to sleep. Sleep is for has-beens, my friend, and you're about to have a very crowded schedule. This marriage scam is paying off big-time. Phone for you. T. McC.! Troy, darling, come to bed. I want to see the Troy McClure I remember from such films... as Make-Out King of Montana and The Electric Gigolo. Yeah. In a minute, darling. Well, she may be helping my career, but she's starting to cramp my style. Oh, who cares? The offers are rolling in. Paramount wants you for a buddy comedy with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant. Those sick freaks? Okay. Then get this. I think they want you to play McBain's sidekick in- brace yourself- the new McBain movie! McBain's sidekick? Hot damn! I'm going to Sea World! Selma, about you and Troy- We're not sure he's all he seems. Marge is right. He's wrong for you. Better you find out sooner than later. Wrong for me? How? Oh, I get it. My sisters have come down with a case of the green-eyed gazungas. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're stuck in a menial job you'll be doing 10 years after you die. And you're tied down to a man who'd have to bathe to be a slob. Selma, Troy doesn't love you at all. He's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life... and further his career. You don't know what you're talking about... and I have to go now and see Troy. Is this a sham marriage? Sure, baby. Is that a problemo? You married me just to help your career? You make it sound so sordid. Look, don't we have a good time together? Yes, but- Don't you have everything you ever wanted here? Money, security, a big, hot, flat rock for Jub Jub? But... don't you love me? Sure, I do, like I love Fresca. Isn't that enough? The only difference between our marriage and anyone else's is we know ours is a sham. Are you gay? Gay? I wish! If I were gay, there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality... one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs. You see- Stop! You're asking me to live a lie. I don't know if I can do that. It's remarkably easy. Just smile for the cameras and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride. You'll go to the right parties, meet the right people. Sure, you'll be a sham wife... but you'll be the envy of every other sham wife in town. So, what do you say, baby? Tell me again about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride. One day, my lady Selma's gonna have a star right next to mine... so watch out, Laszlo Panaflex. Tonight all Hollywood's wondering who'll be chosen to costar... in the big, new McBain pic, McBain IV: Fatal Discharge. Oh! You watching? Mac, you gotta get me that part. I will, but you gotta do something for me. The problem is, the big parts these days are all going to family men. But I already got married! Yeah, but for a role like this, you gotta pour it on-you and wife have gotta have a baby. A baby, eh? What do I do? I'll send you over a pamphlet. You can't buy that kind of P.R., but you can get it for nothing by having a baby... which, by the way, your insurance will cover except for the deductible... which I'll reimburse you for if you get the part... which you will if you have a baby. C'est Troy bien. Okay. Now, listen. Let's talk baby names. You can't use Montana, Dakota or Florida- they're taken. Mmm. Oregon? Oh! Pacific Northwest. Very hot. Having a child- that's a big step. You bet it is! Think what it'll mean! Not just the McBain movie, but maybe my own fragrance- "Smellin' ofTroy"! It is probably my last chance to be a mommy. Cigarette, Mrs. McClure? You bet! From now on, she's smoking for two! Uh, come here, tiger. Hmm. Would you like some wine? Yes! Uh, why don't you come over here... and make yourself more comfortable? No. Why don't you come over here and make yourself comfortable? I'm sorry. This whole concept's foreign to me. Who knew a baby would be so much work? Having a baby isn't supposed to be work. It's supposed to be an expression of the feelings... we're supposed to have for each other. Oh. Like how we built that snowman together in that Newport ad? Remember how "alive with pleasure" they said we were? Look, I'm sorry. A loveless marriage is one thing. We're not hurting anybody. But bringing a child into a loveless family... is something I just can't do. Oh, great! We'll adopt. I'll call my agent. He'll find some kid who wants in on the deal. Good-bye, Troy. I'll always remember you, but not from your films. Come on, Jub Jub. Let's go home, and I'll microwave you some nice roaches. In a bold move that has stunned Hollywood insiders... newly divorced comeback kid Troy McClure... has turned down the supporting lead in McBain IV... to direct and star in his own pet project... The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel. Will the gambit pay off? 20th Century Fox is betting... it will.
#07x20 - Bart on the Road^Ah, spring break in Hong Kong. Custom-made suits at slave-labor prices. I- Good Lord! They've got this all wrong. Yes, this is Principal Seymour Skinner. How can I help you, Principal? I'm afraid there's some problems with my tickets. I asked for a center seat, not an aisle seat. I specifically requested not to have the kosher meal. And I booked the flight leaving Saturday morning, not Friday morning! Okay, I've gone ahead and made those changes. With the one-day advanced purchase price... it's just an extra $7,830. G.M. Chrysler! I can't afford that! But I can't close the school a day early just to suit my vacation. Or can I? Think, Seymour, think. "Go To Work With Your Parents Day"? Yes, Go To Work With Your Parents Day. Tomorrow you will learn by doing... and apply your knowledge of fractions and gym to real-world situations. And Scratchy Show I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work. Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lise. I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV. I'm honored, Bart, and, Lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with Dad. You've been interested in nuclear power for years. I've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant. Well, there you go! Mom, you're blocking the TV. If you need something to do, you can fill out my form. Here. "Parent's occupation. "Please note: Homemaker is not allowed as it is not real work. That's why you don't get paid for it." Bart can take my place at the plant. Oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace. How about Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma at the D.M.V.? Of course! Of course! I would never ever have thought of that. Some days we don't let the line move at all. We call those "weekdays." Good one. At least I'm not stuck at the cracker factory like Milhouse. Wow! Ever wonder how crackers get salted? Have I! Wow! Crackers, ho! I never knew cracker production could be so exciting! But where do they make those crackers with the peanut butter already inside? Uh, put this on and come with me, son. Whoo-hoo! Mmm. Doughnut? No, thanks. Do you have any fruit? This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit. Uh- Oh! This is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I'm responsible for changing most of these lightbulbs. Why are there so many burnt-out ones? 'Cause they won't hire an assistant. Martin, here's $10 to invest in the futures market. Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Martin, you're up one million dollars. Yes! But now you've lost all but $600. You got greedy, Martin. I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me. Maybe we can make your job more fun. What are those? I don't know. Well, what if we used our imaginations? Houston- We have a problem. Homer 13 is spinning out of control! I'm going after him! Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person. Okay. One more step. I just gotta go laminate your license. You'll get it in two to three weeks. Hot damn! No more sittin' in the dirt at the drive-in. Bart, I left the driver's-license-making machine on. Turn it off. Twenty-five years old? You're not 25 years old. This I.D. is completely fake. Yes, you're right, Milhouse. It is a fake, which makes it a fake I.D. A fake I.D.? Cool! And it's our ticket to the best spring break of our lives! One adult and two children, please. I can think of at least two things wrong with that title. Twenty-five? Whoa! Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. "S," but I gotta check everybody. What, are you kidding? I take it as a compliment. Three beers, please. Hey! Join the party! Spring break! Yeah! Well, when are we gonna get rowdy? Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D. We could go rent a carpet shampooer. Greetings, chums! Were your days at work as profitable as mine? I just had a sinful shopping spree at Wee World. We're having the best spring break of our lives, and we don't need you around nerding it up. That job is taken. But surely I and my $600... could play some small part in your vacation fun. Oh, yeah, right. Like there's any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive- Wow.! Ooh, boy, Flipsy! You and I are going on a road trip. Whoa! Ha-ha. Gentlemen, for our road trip, I have taken the liberty... of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi... for use on our parents. I've been selected to represent the school... at the National Grammar Rodeo... at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada. I've been selected to represent the school... at the National Grammar Rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada. I'm going away for a week. See ya.! Nah. The National Grammar Rodeo? I wish I were going. Oh, wait, wait. I mean, I wish I was going. Is that right, Bart? Mm-mmm-mmm. It's not fair! I'm the best student in school. How come I never heard about this competition? Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a "dorkus malorkus." That's not Latin. Mom, Bart's faking it! Oh, honey, you've had your glory. Now it's Bart's turn. Oh.! Oh.! Now, wait.! Oh! Yeah. Wait. Oh. Wait! Oh, oh! Ow! Bart! Nelson hit me! He sure did. A cup holder! Bart, we gotta stop and get a cup! Uh, Bart? Cruise control, my good man. Everybody all set back here? Nelson, good to see ya. Martin, always a pleasure. Oh.! Diablo Canyon 2... why can't you be more like Diablo Canyon 1? Hello? Oh! Homie, hello! I can't remember the last time you called me from- Oh. You want to speak to Lisa. Hi, Lisa. How's your spring break going? I'm learning about owls. Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me. Sure, I would. I can always learn about owls this summer at bird camp. Oh! We've arrived in the vast cornfields of Canada! How much farther to the grammar rodeo? Grammar rodeo? We're going to a grammar rodeo? We're not going to a grammar rodeo. That was just an alibi, Milton. Martin. Martin. Fellows? What? Where are we going? Well, I realize it's trite... but we could tour the bridges of Madison County. Hey! Who has better vacation ideas than Triple-A? According to the publisher of this Triple-A guidebook, no one. I've always wanted to see Macon, Georgia. Wait. How about a fair? Not just a county fair, not just a Europe fair... but a world's fair! The World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. Keep reading. The Hungarians have built a giant, motorized Rubik's Cube... and the fair's symbol is the sun sphere... which sits atop a 266-foot-tall steel shaft. What's inside? An information desk! Cool! So, it's a choice between Disney World and Knoxville. Knoxville, Knoxville, Knoxville! I concur. You made it! Did you have trouble getting past the security guards? Security guards? Great! You want to get some lunch? Sure. The way I figure it... if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs. Why do you need me? It's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready? Ready. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Simpson, what in God's name are you- Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles, Skittles, Whatchamacallits, Twizzlers? They all have hilarious names and are delicious. Well, I am partial to Jolly Ranchers. Mmm. Good work, Simpson. Simpsons. Boy, Lisa, with you here, this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my night shift without you. We could have a slumber party. Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire. It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting goods store. If you kids can't keep your hands to yourself... I'm gonna turn this car around... and there'll be no Cape Canaveral for anybody.! That's it! Back to Winnipeg! Bart, can we stop for ice cream? Yes. Bart, can we weigh the car at that weigh station? Yeah. Bart, can we pick up that hitchhiker? I don't see why not. Bart, could we stop for ice cream? Yes. Well, I didn't think I was rehabilitated, but, uh... I guess they needed the extra bed. With Bart gone, and now you and your father, I'm not gonna have anyone to- Thanks, Mom! Bye! talk to. What is this place? Branson, Missouri. My dad says it's like Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders. Andy Williams! We don't need to stop here. Yes, we do! Wow! I didn't think he was gonna do "Moon River"... but then, bam- second encore. Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first. Eh, truth. Ask me anything. Who do you love most- me, Bart or Maggie? D'oh! All right. Dare. Okay. Why don't you- Hello. I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball... first name "Youra." Youra Snotball? What? How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to lran! Okay. Your turn. Hmm. Truth. Uh, do you have a crush on anyone? Dad! I- I won't tell anybody. Dad, you tell everybody everything. Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist. Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows. Just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secret. Okay. I like... Langdon Alger. I have no idea who that is. Nobody does. He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. But that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone. I've already forgotten his name. It was Larson something, right? Thanks, Dad. Oh, this has been the best spring break ever! And with my patented seminar... you will learn how to corner the real estate market through hypnosis. Why waste your hypnotic powers on neighbors and coworkers? I can't take this anymore. Oh. Oh, there. Oh, Maggie. There. We're on the homestretch. Next stop, the Knoxville World's Fair and its fabulous sun sphere! Hurry up. We've only got four days to spend at the- "Wod Fir"? Uh, excuse me. Is this the world's fair visitor's center? Used to be, back in 1982. You're 14 years too late. But there's another world's fair coming soon, right? Before Friday? What about the sun sphere? You mean the wig sphere. You're welcome to go up there... if you want to see 16,000 boxes of unsold wigs. Now, are you gentlemen gonna buy some wigs or ain't ya? I guess fate was against us. It's really nobody's fault, right? Huh? Right? We've still got a car and a wad of cash. Uh, no, we don't. I must have spent our last $10 on this Al Gore doll. You are hearing me talk. I hate this place. We've got no car. We've got no money. And no one knows we're here! We're stranded! But on the plus side, I knocked over the sun sphere. Ha-ha! This never would've happened if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia. I'm just sayin', is all. Fellows, I think perhaps the time has come to call our parents. No! They'd kill us. Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food and a way to get home. Follow me. Everybody remember- we're parked under the sun sphere. Hey! I need those to see! These lenses are perfect. Now I can rebottom those antique Coke bottles. Three hundred- Hey! Come back. Four hundred, 500, 600- Ow. Five hundred, 400, 300, 200, 100, zero. Come on! This train goes right through Springfield. Well, of course I'll accept. Bart! I've missed you so mu- You want to speak to Lisa? So how's the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart? Lisa, I need your help, so I'm gonna let you in on a secret- there's no such thing. I knew it! I knew it! Because why would they have our national grammar rodeo in another nation? You're gonna be in so much trouble- I'm in trouble already. Here's what happened. So you've got to think of a way I can come home for free. Hmm. You could travel for free if you were a stewardess. Well, how badly do you want to get home? All right, all right. How about a courier? They travel for free too. No, that's a terrier. They're dogs. Well, you sure don't look 25... but your unlaminated, out-of-state driver's license is proof enough for me. Here's your first assignment. What the- Can we call our parents yet, Bart? Lisa. This isn't working. I've got to courier something to Springfield... and it's gotta be big enough to fit Milhouse, Martin and Nelson inside. But, Bart, that'll cost a fortune. Simpson, how would you like to escort 500 Big Macs to Marlon Brando's island? I can't take much more of this. I'm counting on you, Lise. Whee. What's wrong, honey? There's something troubling me, but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret. You don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend. Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore. Okay, but you gotta promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart. I promise. Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license... and drove Milhouse, Nelson and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville... and the car got crushed, and they're out of money and they can't get home... and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong. Yes. That's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment? All right. I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, then I will murder him. No! No! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you. Okay. We'll work this out together. First things first-Where is Knoxville? It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge nuclear facility... birthplace of the atomic bomb. Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge. And Bart could be the courier. Y'ello. Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a, uh- "T-437 safety command console." Uh, Springfield, my computer shows your T-437 is fully operational. Uh, I suggest you- Oh, my God! Oh, God, no! Oh, this can't be happening! You're operating without a T-437, Springfield! Oh, sweet mother of mercy! I mean- I mean, my God! And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of HomerJ. - No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know! Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of Langdon Alger. Bart? Bart? Hey! We really could use another air hole! Shh! They'll know you're in there. But I don't think I'd go back again next year. It's gettin' too commercial. They've forgotten it's supposed to be about the grammar. Hello? Oh, hello, Principal Skinner. No. Bart has never been to Hong Kong. Good night. Good night. Hello? Tennessee State Police? No, my son's car was not crushed in Knoxville. I don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that. Hello? No, Bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam. Homer. Are you laughing at me?

You call hamburgers steamed hams? Yes. It's a regional dialect. Uh-huh. Uh, what region? Uh, upstate New York. Really. Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams." Oh, not in Utica. No. It's an Albany expression. I see. You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger. Oh, no. Patented Skinner burgers. Old family recipe.

Have ye tried a Baltic squid? They can suck the bolts out of a submarine's hull. All right! Fangoria will give me 25 bucks for this shot. I can give you the name of a good gum and hair man. I have a word of advice. Don't try to dig gum out with a bone. It just makes things worse. Leave it in as evidence. Bazooka Joe's got deep pockets. Perhaps I can help. My papa is foreman of the Düsseldorf Gum Works. Some folk'll never eat a skunk but then again some folk'll. Like Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel Hey. What's goin' on on this side? Hey, Brandine.

You may purchase this charming Hamburglar Adventure. A child has already solved the Jumble using crayons. The answer is "fries." Uh, Milhouse, what's going on? You said you just needed to use the bathroom. Now I find you buying comics. Oh, our transaction is completed. You may take the boy. Wait! As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin.

You keep squirming, there's going to be a little bald girl with no lollipop. I love it. I finally look like a real person. Thanks. Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Crud. He's down there. Crud.! Do you find something comical about my appearance... when I am driving my automobile? Yeah. Everyone needs to drive a vehicle- even the very tall. This was the largest auto that I could afford. Should I therefore be made the subject of fun? I guess so. Wh- He- Would you like it if I laughed at your misfortune? Huh? Maybe we should find out. Now march. Hey, everybody. Look at this. It's that boy who laughs at everyone. Let's laugh at him. Ha-ha! Wave to the people. Blow them kisses. Well, Milhouse, I guess interesting stuff does happen to people in Springfield. Yep. Everybody in town's got their story to tell. There's just not enough time to hear 'em all. Oh. Sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab with the running and the exploding and the crying. One of the monkeys stole the glasses off my head. Oh, no, wait. Please, no. Please. I have a funny story, if you listen. I even wrote theme music. Listen. Hey. Hey. Professor Frink Professor Frink. He'll make you laugh He'll make you think. He likes to run and then the thing with the. Person. Oh, boy. That monkey is going to pay.
#07x23 - Much Apu About Nothing^Run, Daddy! Run! Open the door, Maude! I don't have time for the secret knock! Oh.! I'm panicking, Neddy.! I can't work the knob. This is Kent Brockman with a special report from the Channel 6 News copter. A large bearlike animal, most likely a bear... has wandered down from the hills in search of food or, perhaps, employment. Please remain calm. Stay in your homes. Looks like bad news for the... Impson family. Let's all calm down. Everyone's gonna be just fine, as long as I've got enough beers. All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house... I gotta go out and buy some beer. Now, to drop gracefully through the windshield. I got ya, Dad! I got ya, Dad! Sweet dreams, Smokey. Ow! Animal tranquilizer! Oh! Smooth! Book 'em, Lou. One count of being a bear. And one count of being an accessory to being a bear. Oh, Marge, it was horrible! We were trapped in the house all afternoon. And, well, we had to drink toilet water. Well, things were bad everywhere. I'm sick of these constant bear attacks. It's like a freakin' Country Bear Jamboroo around here! Well, now, realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen. Hey, if you want wild bears eating your children... and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me? I am! I am! We're here! We're queer! We don't want any more bears! We're here.! We're queer.! We don't want any more bears.! Hey, Homer, that's a pretty catchy chant. Where'd you learn it? Oh, I heard it at the mustache parade they have every year. We don't want any more bears.! Sir, there's an unruly mob to see you. Does it have an appointment? Uh, yes, it does. I phoned ahead! Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you... but your city is infested with bears! Yeah. And these ones are smarter than the average bear. They swiped my "pic-a-nic" basket. Think of the children! Very well. I promise swift and decisive action against these hibernating hucksters. Ah, not a bear in sight. The Bear Patrol must be working like a charm. That's specious reasoning, Dad. Thank you, honey. By your logic, I could claim this rock keeps tigers away. Oh, how does it work? It doesn't work. Uh-huh. It's just a stupid rock. Uh-huh. But I don't see any tigers around here, do you? Lisa, I want to buy your rock. Whoo-hoo! A perfect day! Zero bears and one big, fat, hairy paycheck. Hey! How come my pay is so low? "Bear Patrol Tax $5.00." What? This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history! Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history. Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer tax. That's the homeowner tax. Well, anyway, I'm still outraged. Down with taxes.! Down with taxes.! Down with taxes.! Won't you think of the children? Are these morons getting dumber, or just louder? Dumber, sir. They won't give up the Bear Patrol... but they won't pay taxes for it either. Ducking this issue calls for real leadership. People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants. That's right. Illegal immigrants. We need to get rid of them! "Immigants. " I knew it was them! Even when it was the bears, I knew it was them. Oh! Won't somebody please think of the children? In one week, the town will vote on a special referendum... whether or not to deport all illegal immigrants from Springfield. It shall be known as Proposition 24. Yea! It shall be known as Proposition 24. Yea! Hey, German boy! Go back to "Germania." I do not deserve this! I've come here legally as an exchange student. Young man, the only thing we exchange for you is our national dignity. You want to pick on immigrants, then pick on Willie! Willie, please! The children want to pick on someone their own size. I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad. Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn. There's no denying it, Sis. But immigration is what America's all about. Even the Simpson family immigrated to America. Right, Grandpa? Okay, you twisted my arm. The Simpson story begins back in the old country. I forget which one exactly. My father would drone on and on about America. He thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread... sliced bread having been invented the previous winter. See this, Son? That's where we're going to live. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday. Later that day, we set sail for America. There it is. Our new home. Whee! I love America! Abe, supper's on! We had to move out once we'd filled the hat with garbage. The end. Yeah, when those immigrants get deported... there'll be a lot more elbowroom for regular joes like you and me, Apu. Mr. Simpson... it may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant. You? I don't believe it. No. In truth, an illegal immigrant, sir. If Proposition 24 passes, I shall be forced to leave this country. Oh, I wish- Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me. Oh, my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24... I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about. You know what, Apu? I am really, really gonna miss you. You know what really "aggravateses" me is them "immigants." They want all the benefits of living in Springfield... but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language. Yeah. Those are exactly my "sentimonies." Yeah! Yeah, you said it, Barn. Make the protesters go away, and I'll give you the entire bottle. Oh, thank you goodness. My first customers in a week. It's hard to believe someone so close to our family... could be an illegal alien. Alas, it is true. I came here shortly after my graduation from Cal Tech... Calcutta Technical lnstitute. As the top student in my graduating class of seven million... I was accepted for graduate study in the United States. Mmm. Wherever you go and whatever you do, we will always love you. Make us proud, Son. Never forget who you are. I won't, Mother. And I won't forget you, Manjula. I'm so sorry our arranged marriage will not come to pass. Farewell, my beloved. I enrolled at Springfield Heights lnstitute of Technology... under the tutelage of the brilliant professor, John Frink. Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7 looks impressive- don't touch it- but I predict that within 100 years, computers will be twice as powerful... 10,000 times larger... and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will own them. Could it be used for dating? Well, theoretically, yes. But the computer matches would be so perfect as to eliminate the thrill of romantic conquest. Nine glorious years later, I completed my Ph. D. thesis. 200,000 precisely ordered punch cards... comprising the world's very first tic-tac-toe program. Only the top human players could beat it. Hey, what's this one for? Oh! So, Apu, why didn't you go back to lndia when your student visa expired? I did not feel right leaving without paying off my student loans. Mm-hmm. So I took a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. When my debts were wiped clean, I was all set to go. But by then I had made so many friends here. What you're saying is so understandable. And, really, your only crime was violating U.S. law. Oh, you are one of the good ones. You know what? I'm going to vote no on 24. Mom, you're the greatest! Could I have this licorice? Uh, good evening, um, young man. My name is Charles Norwood. Furthermore, to this beer, I would also like three of your finest, cheapest cigars. Here's my I.D. which confirms my "adultivity." Hmm. Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D., it is truly excellent. Say, if you tell me where you obtained it... I will overlook the ice cream sandwiches concealed in your armpits, eh? Deal. Okay. Here are your fraudulent documents, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilon. Your U.S. passport, social security card... birth certificate, and your death certificate. Just hold onto that one in your safe-deposit box. Most humble and grateful thanks to you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can the courtesy. You're an American now. Remember. You were born in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Your parents were Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon. And if you do not wish to arouse suspicion, I strongly urge you to act American. Hey there, Homer. How's it hanging? Low and lazy. So- Hey. Say something again. Oh, you're just noticing the way I'm talking to you now. You see, it turns out I am an American citizen after all. Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The "Ny" Mets are my favorite squadron. Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue. Oh, yeah. What was I thinking with that? Who needs the infinite compassion of Ganesha... when I've got Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me... from Entertainment Weekly with their dead eyes? Look at me! I've betrayed my lndian heritage, sir! What would my parents think of me now? Make us proud, Son. Never forget who you are. Don't make the same mistake I did. Oh, forgive me, Mother. Father, I've failed you. Who am I kidding? I am no citizen. This passport is a cheap forgery! A cheap, $2,000 forgery. I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland and to myself. Don't forget Ganesha. I cannot deny my roots, and I cannot keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land... where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me... not as some yahoo from Green Bay. Oh. Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu! I'm not gonna let them kick you out! I never should've bought this button! Can I have my three dollars back? Store credit only. Hey, Marge.! Look who I brought home.! Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants? No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake. All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu. That's nice, although three of you are below voting age. And I'm not registered. I do appreciate your concern, really. But it is hopeless. The latest poll shows a whooping 85% support for Proposition 24. Hey, Apu, why don't you just marry some American broad... then dump her after you get your citizenship? Hello, Selma? Selma, my dear. How are ya? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported? I'd rather eat poison. My name's already Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Hutz McClure. God knows it's long enough without Nahassapetapeeta-whatever. From now on, I'm only marrying for love. Possibly once more for money. Oh, it's hopeless. Oh, poor Apu. Hey! The government don't control the sky. What if you lived in a balloon? That's it.! Did you hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me. No! Not what he said, what he is. Grandfather, as in grandfather clause. Apu, how long ago did your visa expire? Seven years. But I don't- There was an amnesty declared for people who have been here as long as you. That means you can take the citizenship test! Oh! But, Apu, the vote on Proposition 24 is on Tuesday. You'll have to pass the test before then. Oh, no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history. Oh, it can't be that many. Come on, Apu. I'll be your tutor. Please identify this object. It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year. Correct. Now, we all know the 13 stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars? Because this particular flag is ridiculously out-of-date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912... after New Mexico became a state, but before Arizona did. Uh, partial credit. Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S. So, let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield. Right here. Dad, you're not pointing anywhere near Springfield. It's over here, Apu. Hey! What you doin'? Studyin'? Oh, I'm so confused. I don't even know where I'm getting kicked out of anymore. Whoa! Sign's floating away, Chief. Executive, legislative and, uh, judicial. No, no and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college. Please, Mr. Simpson. My brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours. And many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me. Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now, I'm gonna go to bed... while you look over my notes from ninth-grade history. Okay, Apu. Stay awake and stay focused. Cotton Mather- Oh, no! I fell asleep! I have forgotten everything that Mr. Homer taught me! Perfect. Let's roll. Immigrant go home! Immigrant go home! Get outta here! Gosh, you're annoying. Hmm. Hmph. Hmm. All right, men. Here's the order of deportations. First you'll be rounding up your tired, then your poor... then your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Breathers. Got it. All right, here's your last question. What was the cause of the Civil War? Actually, there were numerous causes. Aside from the obvious schism between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists... economic factors, both domestic and international- Hey, hey! Yeah? Just say slavery. Slavery it is, sir. Yes! I am a citizen! Now, which way to the welfare office? What? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I work. I work. Thank you. I want to say thank you to everyone. From this day forth, I am no longer an lndian living in America. I am an lndian American. Yeah! You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants. Except Native Americans. Yeah. Native Americans like us. No. I mean American lndians. Like me. No. I mean- Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker. Now that you're all relaxed- Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid... they're driving the cabs that get us home safely... they're writing the operas that entertain us every day... they're training our tigers and kicking our extra points. These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society. If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all. When you go to the polls tomorrow... please vote no on Proposition 24. No on 24. No on 24. No on 24. No on 24. No on 24. No on 24. No on 24. It's a landslide! Yes on 24. The proposition passed with a record 95%. When are people going to learn? Democracy doesn't work! Please don't knock the land that I love. Jury duty! Oh! Today I am truly an American citizen. Just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about. Ach! Ingrates.
#07x24 - Homerpalooza^You know, most of my life I've- I've had to live with the shame of being a screw-up. But now, as I stand here with the award for the district's safest bus driver... well, i-it's like a dream come true. Otto.! Wake up.! Huh? Aah! Aah! So, um, who's good at keepin' secrets? "Dear parents, due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard... "the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. "By reading this letter out loud... "you have waived any legal responsibility on our part... in perpetuity, throughout the universe." Well, we'll have to organize a carpool. Hey! Every day will be like a road trip! With your dad! To school! So... how about those rainbow suspenders, huh? Dad- Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh? Dad! I see these kids now with "jive" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say "jive." Dad! Please just drive the car, Dad. I'm watching the road, sweetie. "You jive turkey!" See? You got to sass it. "Quit jivin' me, turkey!" You got to sass it. A turkey is a bad person. KFSL- Fossil 103. Classic hits from ABBA to Zeppelin, comma, Led. Tell him! Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir? Can you please change the radio station? But this is Grand Funk Railroad. You guys back there know Grand Funk, right? Nobody knows the band Grand Funk? The wild, shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drum work of Don Brewer? Oh, man! For more information on Grand Funk... consult your school library. When I listen to a really good song... I start nodding my head, like I'm saying "Yes!" to every beat. "Yes! Yes! Yes! This rocks!" And then sometimes I switch it up, like- "No! No! No! Don't stop a-rockin'!" Dad, please. You're embarrassing us. No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music. Now, Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane... which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for The Alan Parsons Project... which I believe was some sort of hovercraft. Dad, no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever! I'm just trying to party with you guys. Homer, first of all, it's "par-tay"... and second, we wouldn't "par-tay" with you... if you were the last dad on Earth. Hi there. It's been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by Bread? Oldies. Oldies? But you've got all the top bands in here! Styx? I just heard them on the King Biscuit Flower Hour.! Now, here are some of your no-name bands. Sonic Youth? Nine-Inch Nails? Hullabalooza? Hullabalooza is a music festival. The greatest music festival of all time? There can be only one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the Us Festival. The what festival? The Us Festival! Yeesh! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers. What computers? Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact. Quadraphonic sound, a water bed, and now a strobe light. Gentlemen, say hello to the Second Base-Mobile. Wicked! Back then we didn't care what anyone thought... and the chicks found that irresistible. I think you're cool, Homer Simpson. Sandra, that was mean. But most of all, I remember the music. What the hell are you two doin'? It's called rockin' out. You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it. I used to be "with it." But then they changed what "it" was. Now what I'm with isn't "it," and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you! No way, man. We're gonna keep on rockin' forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. Forever. What's wrong, Homie? I went to the record store today and they were playing all this music I never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy. Hmm. Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business. That's fine for you, Marge... but I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-er-y day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've gotta get out of this rut and back into the groove! Well, good! Try to include Bart and Lisa. Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today... we promise to build several churches in your honor. Bart! No! Hey, wait! I'm okay today! My mom bought me deodorant! Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse. I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine. What are you talking about? Well? What have we here? Looks like your uncool dad... scored tickets to Hullabalooza! Bart, these look real. Check the authenticator spot. This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic refreshment, eat Clark bars. And for totally outrageous class rings, it's Jostens. Go, Jostens! You're not going to school today. Today your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher- four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness... while you rock out with your father! Whoo-hoo! Wow, it's like Woodstock... only with advertisements everywhere... and tons of security guards. People, have your tickets out. Throw your cameras out. Surrender all identification. Ohh! My homemade Kahlua! Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people. Hey! A freak show! Oww! Thank you. Thank you very much. And now the band you've all been waiting for, Cypress Hill! Before we start- We have a lost child here. If she's not claimed within the next hour... she will become property of Blockbuster Entertainment. What is that smell? It smells like Otto's jacket. Dude, karma. What? Karma. Karma. Oh, I get it. Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a Rastafarian hat! Hey, I been safari-in' since before you were born. Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music. Well, excu-u-use me! You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while. Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people. All right! Yeah! Cool concert. Am I right? Yeah, nice try, narc. Where's the narc? Who? That fat Jamaican guy. What'd I say? What's goin' on? Hey, we're just tryin' to have a good time, narc. Why do you want to destroy us? Don't commit your hate crimes here! Hate crime! Okay, I'm heading out now. More butt support. More butt support! D'oh! It may be bleak... but this music is really getting to the crowd. Ah, making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel. Oh! Makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school, and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise. I'll never be part of the scene again. Uh-oh. Oh, man, There goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna be pissed off. You're damn right I'm gonna be pissed off! I bought that pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale! Dad, are you okay? I'm fine. Sir, I run Hullabalooza's Pageant of the Trans-Mundane- the freak show- and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like very much for you to be that fatso. So, you wanna go on tour with a traveling freak show. I don't think I have a choice, Marge. Of course you have a choice. How do you figure? You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along. You know, Marge, in some ways... you and I are very different people. And now, get ready for the man... with the iron stomach! Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good? Thank you. Thank you very much. Stay in school. Your hero, Homer. Hey, Cannonball. I like your statement. When life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins. Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music... they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide. Well, we try to make a difference. "Dear Bart and Lisa"- All is well on tour... with America's most popular alternative music festival. Our firstjob is to entertain. And I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well. But the main thing is... I finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction... that makes rock and roll the king of music. Whoo-hoo! Hello, ticket holders! Oh, here comes that cannonball guy. He's cool. Are you being sarcastic, dude? I don't even know anymore. Thank you! And remember, don't trust anyone over 30! And now, Peter Frampton! Thanks, Homer. Homer Simpson, everyone! Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown, Springfield. Is it true that we have to bring our own water? We got a little rule back home- If it's brown, drink it down. If it's black, send it back. The hometown show's the big one, Homer. People who called you a weirdo in high school get to see what a successful freak you've become. Hey, I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the audio-visual club. Really? Me too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors. Anyway, get ready, beer belly. We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of! All right, Homer! Yeah, Homer.! That was odd. Gee, I don't like the sound of that. No biggie. I'm cool. Nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet. My God.! Those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. From now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods... and when you lie in a hammock, please... rest your beer on your head or your genitals. Rules. I'm a rocker! I don't care for rules. Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to the gut, you will die. Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dyin' would be a stone groove! Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix? Yes. Pick up your puppy. So, what's it like being famous, Dad? People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.! Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs? Nope! What religion are you? You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life. Uh, Christianity. What's with all the questions? Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie? Sure. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Mmm. Clear the way. Clear the way! Performer coming through! This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play. Mom! Ha-ha! Hello, bands.! Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? Come on, people. Somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra. Possibly while high! Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction. Hey, man, did we order an orchestra? What's up with this orchestra? Where'd the orchestra come from, man? I don't know. You didn't tell me about this, man. We gotta do somethin'. Uh, yeah, we think we did. Uh, do you know "Insane in the Brain"? We mostly know classical, but we could give it a shot. Now, this I like. Man, that guy's guitar is talkin'! Hey, my shoes are talkin' too! Don't worry. We won't hurt you. We only want to have some fun. And to think, Smithers, you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. "Nobody's going to pay a hundred-percent service charge." Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich and the ignorant, sir. Do you feel like we do, Springfield? Yeah! Do y- Wait. Do ya- Do ya feel- Do- Do ya feel- Oh, come on! Do you feel- Homer Simpson wrecks my pig... Cypress Hill steals my orchestra... and Sonic Youth's in my cooler! Get out of there, you kids! Oh, come on, Mr. Frampton. You're not gonna eat all that watermelon. Please! I'm trying to perform. Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler. Twenty-five years I've been in this- I've never- And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for! The man who embodies everything about rock and roll- except the music. Give it up for your very own homegrown hero... Homer Simpson.! I used to carpool with that guy! Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the reaper. Ohh! I'm gonna die! Cannons are designed to hurt. They're designed to hurt! Shh! Mom! Dad needs our support. You're the coolest dad alive! Oh, Marge, I thought I had an appetite for destruction... but all I wanted was a club sandwich. There might be one in this cooler. Oh! Here we go. Ohh! Oh, man, Homer wussed out. I'm so disillusioned. Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks. It's about music and advertising... and youth-oriented product positioning. That, and getting toasted. Nicely toasted. Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak. Unless that's his act. I expect your letter of resignation on my desk. You have a desk? I mean the hood of my car. I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak worldview. I've got too much to live for. We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions of fans... our millions of dollars and our youth. Whoo-hoo! Let's all go out and buy fur coats! I want a walk-in humidor. So I realized that being with my family is more important... than being cool. Dad, what you just said was powerfully uncool. You know what the song says. It's hip to be square. That song is so lame. So lame that it's... cool? No. Am I cool, kids? No. Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool- not caring. Right? No. Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here. Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool. Sure you do. How else would you know?
#07x25 - Summer of 4 ft. 2^Hey, Bart! Summer's almost here. Which kind of sprinkler do you like? The one that goes like this? Or the one that goes like this? Oh, and there's this one! It's the last day of school, Milhouse. Try to show some dignity. Gentlemen, start your chimes. School's out! Up yours, Krabappel! Well, I'm glad the rest of you remembered... that summer vacation starts at the end of the day... not the beginning. Here you go, ma'am. Hmm. Quick work. How'd you know he was gonna run? We've got someone on the inside. The reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice. Retrospecticus. Oh. The leatheroleum covers were worth the extra money! Oh! You can smell the benzene! Oh, when the kids see these layouts and fonts... you're going to be the most popular girl in school! You know something, Beezee? I think you're right. "And so, as Abraham Lincoln sat in Ford's Theatre that night... John Wilkes Booth entered, drew his gun and"- Well, that's it. Have a nice summer, everyone. But what happened in Ford's Theatre? Was President Lincoln okay? He was fine. Go home, Ralph. In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. I hope everyone still has theirs. Who died and made you boss? Mr. Estes, the publications adviser. I edited the whole thing. If you hadn't done it, some other loser would have, so quit milking it. Hey! Will you guys sign my yearbook? Huh? This is Becky. She's in the second grade. Hi, Becky. Thanks for coming out. "See ya." He writes the way people talk! Your daughter is named Seymour? Well, I-Yeah. I lied. It's for me. I don't get it. Straight A's, perfect attendance, bathroom timer- I should be the most popular girl in school. Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case. Seems a man drove up onto a traffic island... and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums. Now they're trying it as a maritime offense. So, anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house, free of charge? I only get two weeks of vacation a year... and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house? Well, if it'll seal the deal... I'll take a look at your septic tank, see if I can get her humming again. Deal! See, Flanders? You give a little, you get a little. Hello, Mr. Brown Ground. What you got for me? And you're sure the Flanderses won't be there? Well, it sounds great. Bart, you can invite Milhouse. Lisa, you can bring a friend too. Hey, great! A friend- or a companion... or- I don't know- a stuffed animal. Well, did you call one of your friends? Friends? Huh! These are my only friends- grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal. And even he's kissed more boys than I ever will. Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls. Mom, why don't I have any friends? We have each other. When I was a lonely little girl... I always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend. We are best friends, Mom, but I'm a kid. I need friends my own age too. Honey, you'll make plenty of friends. All you have to do is be yourself. Be myself? I've been myself for eight years, and it hasn't worked. Look at all these dorky clothes. A bathing cap, nose plugs. A microscope at the beach? Aah! What was I thinking? Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again. Ow! Lisa, let's go! Here- Hmm. Somebody's traveling light. Nah. Maybe you're getting stronger. Well, I have been eating more. Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree. Bye-bye, job. Bye-bye, toothbrush. Bye-bye, Lisa Simpson. When the hell are we gonna get to- Where the hell are we going? It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's known as America's scrod basket. I thought Springfield was America's scrod basket. No. Springfield is America's crud bucket... at least according to Newsweek. "Wel-diddly-elcome, Simpsons." Oh, geez! He actually wrote "diddly." That was thoughtful. "I left a few helpful notes around the house." Ah, come- Gee.! "Put food in me." I'll take that. Well, duh! With what, Ned? Nice try, Todd. Isn't this fun, honey? It must be exciting to make a different set of beds. I know you're joking, but it is! Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach? Well, it's kind of funny. With all the craziness and confusion and meshuggaas of packing, I forgot to pack! Lisa, that's not at all like you. Exactly. Hmm. I forgot my swimsuit, too, but I improvised. Hello. Uh, Mom, I'm kind of trying to go for a different look this year. Oh, okay. Ooh! How about this adorable sunsuit? It has a starfish on the fanny, and it comes with its own pail. Mom, come here.! Bring money.! So, where do you want to show off your new, hip togs? The Sherbet Shop, the Candle District? Big Sue's Tap-Water Taffy? If it's okay with you, Mom, I'd rather go find some kids. Oh. Okay. You'll be my friend. I'm never, never gonna let you get away. Hey, hey! Last one in is a yearbook editor! Full speed ahead! Prepare to dive! Dive! It's low tide, boys. I wonder where all the kids are. Hey! A library! No, I can't. That's the old, nerdy Lisa. Lisa, read about my adventures in the South Seas... and make me live again. We've got periodicals on microfiche. Won't you join our tea party? It would be ever so- Don't do it, Lisa! It's a trick! Run! Run.! Oh. I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance. So he goes, like- I can totally hear him going that. Only kids are that incoherent! So, my mom tried to take me to some candle place, but I'm all, like, "No way." Like, you know, whatever. Like, you know, whatever. Hey! What's hap- Okay, okay, okay. Not your fault. It's a bird thing. You don't control the birds. You will someday, but not now. Hi. 'Sup? Who's that? I don't know. Some kid. Hey! I like your hat. A compliment! Scanning for sarcasm. It's clean. Go! Thanks. Um, you guys skate? Try to. The cops always confiscate our boards. Yeah. And you just know they're using them, like, five minutes later down at the station. Hmm. I think I know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted. Like, you know, whatever. All right! Excellent! Okay. Hey, this place rocks! What'd you say your name was? Didn't. It's Lisa. I'm Erin. So, how'd you know about this place? You into books? Me? Unlikely. My gooney brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front. Oh. You like hanging out too? Well, it beats doin' stuff. Yeah. Stuff sucks. Hey, you up? You can use my board. No! Okay. Thanks. That's very, um, rad of you. Hmm. Hey, Bart! Lisa's skateboarding with some cool kids. And she looks like Blossom. Lisa? With people? If they're impressed by her, I'm gonna Bart their world. Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill. Right. You go over and wow them. I hide in the shrubs. Hot stuff comin'through. My friendship- You know you want it. That kid, like, tries too hard. Sh'yeah! The whole thing smacks of effort, man. That's my dorky little brother, Bart- holomew. Who does he think he is with that slingshot in his back pocket? Dennis the Menace? Mr. Wilson or something. How'd it go? Are we down with them? No! They must've seen you. Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game? Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer. Open the door for your mystery date. Ooh! Captain of the football team. He's a dreamboat. Don't wait up, Marge. Okay, Bart. Your turn, your turn. You got the dud! Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter! How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends? You got friends. You got the dud right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter. Wow, Lisa.! I never appreciated all this, like, sea junk before. Hey, that clam's got legs! That's a hermit crab. When she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit. Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach. Aw, a gift from my favorite crustacean. Um, did you learn that word from a teacher or something? No. No, I heard it on Baywatch. Oh, cool. That's cool. Baywatch. David Hasselhoff, man. Ah. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual like you buy 'em all the time. Hi. Um- Let me have one of those porno magazines, large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper, a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas- no, make it two. My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks... is prohibited in this state and is punishable by- Follow me. Any red-blooded, flag-feeding American would love... the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it. All right. Pretty cool of your mom to let us hang out here. Totally. Not like my mom. She'd be butting in with Rice Krispies squares and Tang. My dad's all stoked 'cause today's the Fourth of July. He woke me up at dawn to take a loyalty oath. Ugh. My mom's French, so we only celebrate Bastille Day. Well, we could do something fun. Um, how 'bout a beach party? Oh, great idea, Lise. Hey, I know where there's a beach! I know where we could get some baguettes. Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer... but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat? This baby's sure to kill something. Okay now, everybody. Stand back while I celebrate freedom! Bart, give me your matches. Fresh out. No lighter? Nothing? Oh! Wait. I got it. D'oh! The beer! Oh! This is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America. Come on, Milhouse. Let's go down there. I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends. They're my friends rightfully. She only got them by copying me. Don't have a cow, man! See? That's my expression! Oh. You haven't said that in four years. Let Lisa have it. It's the principle. She's gotta learn. No! Now, park your keister, "meister." Ay, caramba! Hey, Lise. I made something for you. It's a friendship bracelet. For me? Wow! My first real friend... ship bracelet. I don't have anything for you, except this necklace I made. Oh, cool. Thanks. Hey, cinnamon dental floss! I just know we're gonna be friends forever. So, Lisa has a friend. We'll see about that. Bart! I need my glasses. Oh. Nice doggy. I'm dizzy! I'm nauseous! Oh, but I'm popular! Huh? What's he doing here? My yearbook. No! Mm-hmm. Hey, you guys! You want to see how cool Lisa Simpson really is? Check this out. Miss Perfect Attendance... Grammar Rodeo head buckaroo, the French table. Ooh-la-la! "Teacher's pet"? Hey, Lise. I guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough... but it did teach you a lesson. It's important to be yourself. I know exactly who I am. I am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean, little sneak! You cost me my only friends! You've ruined my life! Hey, kids! There's a carnival tonight! Oh, boy! A carnival! Hmm. Kids, stop that! Don't make me get the carny! Hey, Lisa! Make friends with this! Hey! Help! Help! Remember, kids, there's no need to bump. Just enjoy the ride. Oh! Lisa, wait! Being myself didn't work. Being someone else didn't work. Maybe I just wasn't meant to have friends. Lisa is gonna freak when she sees this. Well, hurry up. They'll be back soon. Lisa! Okay. You found out I'm an overachieving bookworm. So whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a Polaroid. I'm going to sleep. Wait, Lisa.! Look. Huh? Oh! Oh! Oh! Cool, huh? Well, now you can take the beach with you wherever you go. Uh, but don't drive at night. Does this mean you still want to be friends... even though I tried to cover up my nerdish leanings? Look, we don't care who you were... and you can't fake the kind of good person that you are. Yeah. You taught us about cool things... like nature and why we shouldn't drink seawater. This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever- Sweet merciful crap.! My car.! The polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. Shoo! Shoo! I guess I should give this back to you. I showed it to your friends again before we left. Bart! Look inside. Oh. Thanks, Bart. I signed it too. Uh-huh. Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.
#08x01 - Treehouse of Horror VII^Ah. [Clattering] [Person Moans] [Footsteps Running] Did you hear that, Bart? Maybe it was just the cat. No, she's sleeping with me. [Meows] [Clattering] [Person Muttering] Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night? Attic? Oh, that's silly. [Laughing Loudly] Seriously, though, don't ever go up there. Homer, isn't it about time for the... you know. Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it. ♪ [Singing Novelty Song] ♪ [Whistling] [Water Splatters] [Person Munching, Chewing] [Homer Shudders] [Chewing Continues] [Clattering] [Person Growls] [Whimpering] What's up there? Yeah, is it a monster? What's the secret? No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids, and all you do is- What? Three. We have three kids, Homer. Yeah. Three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions? No, what? What does happen? Huh? Does something happen to nosy kids who ask questions? Hurry up. Mom and Dad'll be home soon. [Bart Yelps, Grunts] [Gasps] The unsold copies of Dad's autobiography. Oh, my God, Bart. Look! [Gasps] [Both Whimpering] [Chortling] [Both Yelling] [Lisa, Muffled] Bart, do you think it's safe? [Bart, Muffled] I don't care. I can't breathe in here. [All Gasping] See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain? [Together] Mom, Dad, we saw something in the attic! You went into the attic? [Gasps] I'm very disappointed and terrified. Oh, my God, Marge. It's escaped! [All Gasp] [Running Footsteps] [Thunderclap] Yes, Doctor. It's what we've always feared: It's loose. Hugo is loose! See ya soon. Hmm? Who or what is Hugo? Hmm. I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart. You see, you have a brother. So I have two brothers? Lisa, please! Yes, Bart. You have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity. A monstrous irregularity. - [Thunderclap] [Both Yelp] Yes. I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing like... Siamese twins! I believe they prefer to be called "conjoined twins." And hillbillies prefer to be called "sons of the soil," but it ain't gonna happen. Now, normally, the birth of Siamese twins is a joyous occasion... but unfortunately, one of them was... pure evil. [Chomping Continues] I think I'll bottle-feed that one. [Dr. Hibbert Narrating] A routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It was then I knew the only option was to separate you two immediately. You'll both need to sign these. [Chuckles] [Dr. Hibbert Narrating] But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. So we did the only humane thing. We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal... and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. It saved our marriage. You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar- [Yelps] We've got to find Hugo. We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to. I'll start with Radio Shack. Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game. [Heavy Chain Rattles] [Hugo Groans] You're here, aren't you? Yes, Bart. I never left you. Wh-What do you want from me? You'll see... after the surgery. [Screams] [Thunderclap] You're crazy. Am I? Well, perhaps we're all a little crazy. I know I am. I went mad after they tore us apart, but I'll be sane... once I sew us back together. But you'll kill both of us. No. It's easy. Look. I've been practicing. I made a pigeon-rat. Let's get started. You wanna be on the right or the left? [Yelps] Hugo, stop! Huh? [Chuckles] There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in here- Why, you've probably never even seen your own face in the mirror, have you? Here. Hmm? We think we saw Hugo at the airport. He was boarding a plane to Switzerland, and- Oh. You know, isn't it interesting... how the left, or "sinister," twin is invariably the evil one? I had this theory that- Wait a minute. Hugo's scar is on the wrong side. He couldn't have been the evil, left twin. That means the evil twin is and always has been... Bart. Oh, don't look so shocked. W-Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part. But I think there's a way to set everything right. [Chuckling] Care for a drumstick, Hugo? Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin. [All Laughing] He's so cute. Ah, he's a cute guy. Hey, can I have some turkey? Oh, you finish your fish heads, then we'll talk. This tooth will be perfect for my science project. Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food... but I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone. Hey, Lise, check out my science project. [Static Crackles] Ow. What's that supposed to prove? That nerds conduct electricity. Ow! [Laughs] [Static Crackles] Ow! Stupid Bart. [Crackling Continues] [Birds Chirping] Oh, boy. Mold! That's science-fair pay dirt. Hmm, looks about the same. Ah. Whoa. [Gasps] Tiny little people! My God! I've created life. Marge: Lisa, breakfast! We're having waffles. Ooh, waffles. Hey, these aren't waffles. These are just square pancakes. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. The waffle iron's in the shop. That waffle iron's been in the shop forever. So, how are my little Stone Age tub dwellers? Oh, my gosh. They're evolving so quickly. They've already reached the Renaissance. Wait. One of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral. [Gasps] I've created Lutherans. [Electricity Humming, Crackling] Wow. It's almost like seeing into the future. Hey, what is this goo? You tryin' to grow a friend? Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school? Whoops, my finger slipped. Whoops, my finger slipped. [Crunching] Whoops, my finger slipped. Bart! Stop it! [Laughing] [Sirens Wailing] [People Screaming] Oh! My poor little guys.

Um, uh- [Laughs] Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat. Hmm? Wow. Having a place like this has always been my dream, Homer. What's your dream? Um, to work for you? [Chuckles] Don't do that. My butt is for sitting, not for kissing. Now, you tell me the truth. What's your real dream? Your real dream! Um, someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys. I bet people laughed at you when you told 'em that dream. Yeah. Homer, don't give up. They laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat. I was the first wealthy man in America to ever do that. Now they all do it! Did you ever hear of Mike Milken? Ye- No. Hi there. Nice to see you. Now, Homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears... and should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. Your job will be to manage and motivate 'em. Give 'em the benefit of your years of experience. Don't worry. That won't take long. The key to motivation is trust. Let me show you what I mean. I want you to close your eyes and fall backwards, and I'll catch you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready? All right. Three, two- [Rings] One second. Hello? D'oh! Oh, my God! A guy's on the floor! That was a phone call. Don't chalk that up to mistrust. Yes? What happened? When did that happen? How much of it? Oh, my goodness. I'll be right up. Homer, I gotta go upstairs. There's a problem. Somebody ate part of my lunch. I'm gonna leave everything to you. We're on a tight schedule. You keep them motivated. Are you guys working? Yes, sir, Mr. Simpson. Could you, um, work any harder than this? Sure thing, boss. Hey, call me Homer. [Children Chattering] [Making Fart Noises] [All Laughing] You got a fresh sound. It'll play well at this school. Hey, Bart, do you have a best friend yet? 'Cause I've been looking for someone to boss me around. [Door Opens] Okay, folks, let's do it to it. [Chuckles] Grammar, that is. Uh, everybody write down this sentence and circle the nouns. Bart, as the newest addition to our menagerie, you have the honors. Um, uh- Well, start by readin' the sentence. "Two... wentam and jolly were"- [Mumbles] [Makes Fart Noise] So, you never learned cursive? Uh, well, I know hell and damn and bit- Cursive handwriting. Script. Do you know the multiplication tables? Long division? I know of them. Hmm. You know, Bart, I think you'd profit from a more remedial environment. I'm sure you'll feel right at home in the Leg-Up Program. [Gasps] [Groans] Guess I can't complain. Everything's perfect here. So, what are you in for? I moved here from Canada, and they think I'm slow, eh? I fell off the jungle gym, and when I woke up I was in here. I start fires. Okay. Now, everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of paper. This week I hope we can finish our work on the letter "A." Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class... and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they are? Cuckoo! [All] Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy! Look, lady, I'm supposed to be in the fourth grade.

Yes, you are. You are so reticulated. Hi, Mrs. Owl. [Hoots] You're out kind of early. ♪ [Singing] [Screeches, Hoots] [Chattering] Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up two percent... and it's all because of my motivational techniques... like doughnuts, and the possibility of more doughnuts to come. I knew you'd do well, Homer. Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat! [Gasps] Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! "To Berman's Dry Cleaning. Best wishes, Tom Landry." Why don't you buy it? I can't buy that. Only management-type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. [Gasps] Guys like me! I'm a guy like me! All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance. Hey, ifTom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you... then I should just quit right now. I'm sorry. We're just a little tired, sir. We've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor online. Tired, eh? What you guys need is hammocks. Uh, hi, Homer. What can I do for you? Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks. Hammocks? My goodness, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that? Hammocks! Homer, there's four places. There's the Hammock Hut. That's on Third. Uh-huh. There's Hammocks-R-Us. That's on Third too. You got Put-Your-Butt-There. Mm-hmm. That's on Third. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. Right. Matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. It's the hammock complex on Third. Oh, the hammock district. That's right. Ready for the linkup, Mr. Scorpio. Homer, one second. I gotta take care of this. Very important. Be right back. Fine. Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Scorpio. I have the doomsday device. You have 72 hours to deliver the gold... or you'll face the consequences. And to prove I'm not bluffing, watch this. Oh, my God, the 59th Street bridge! Maybe it just collapsed on its own. We can't take that chance. You always say that. I want to take a chance. Collapsed on its own? You, sh- You have 72 hours. See ya. Back to the hammocks, my friend. Yes. You know, there's a little place called Mary Ann's Hammocks. The nice thing about that place is Mary Ann gets in the hammock with you. [Laughs] I'm just kidding. Oh. You know who invented the hammock, Homer? No. That's something for you to do. Find that out. Any sugar around here? Try in there, Homer. Hi, Homer. I'm keepin' two of my fingers crossed... that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow. Uh, yes, sir. No problemo. Good. By the way, Homer, what's your least favorite country? Italy or France? France. [Chuckles] Nobody ever says ltaly. [Motor Whines] I never noticed this office before. Why should you? It's mine.

Well, it's pretty important. Say, what's goin' on? I'm having a little trouble with the government. Oh, those jerks- always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government. What's the problem? Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield. [Screaming] Let 'em go. You'll stay here with me. We'll go bowling. What's bothering 'em? Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things. Well, you can't argue with the little things. It's the little things that make up life.

Do you have receipt, quote, unquote "sir"? No, I do not have a receipt. I won it as a door prize at the Star Trek convention... although I find their choice of prize highly illogical... as the average Trekker has no use for a medium-sized belt. Whoa, whoa. A fat, sarcastic Star Trek fan. You must be a devil with the ladies. Hey, l- [Sighs] That- Oh. Gee, I hate to let you down, Casanova, but, uh, no receipt, no return. I'll give you four bucks for it.

It's a tactical pants retaining system. Check it out. Compass, matches... whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon/lie detector... sphygmomanometer, and it's even got turn signals. Wow, neat! Uh-oh! Hey, Simpson, wanna trade belts? Well, not really... 'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord. Hey, dude, he's raggin' on your cord. Get him! No running!

Call the police! Hey, Dad. Looking good, Son. Hey! What happened to your belt? Some bullies beat me up and took it. Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand- squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start. But then they'll just beat me up even worse. Yes, they are a clever bunch. I know. I'll squeal for ya... to their parents. That's for telling me how to raise my lousy kid. This is for the crummy life I've had to live. [Groans] The thing is- [Grunts] Bart really loves that belt and- [Grunts] Hey, something's wrong with this guy. He's not fallin' down. [Gun Cocks] Moe: Fun's over, fellas! If you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum. Geez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kind of punishment. I mean, you took a three-man pounding and didn't even fall down. Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings. There you go. That's the spirit. Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you. You know, boxin' might be right up your alley. Really? Oh, please. It's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal. [Gasps] Dressing? Their choice. You really think I could do it? Well, I don't know. Are you man enough to test every one of your limits? Yes. And are you man enough... to throw a punch should the opportunity arise? Yes! And are you man enough to give me a 60% cut? Yes! I'll take it. Whoo-hoo! [Boxing Bell Rings] Moe: Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career... I want you to have complete faith in me. Come here. Let me show you somethin'. Wow, I've never been in here before. Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979... I turned it into an office. You used to be a boxer just like me? Yup. They called me Kid Gorgeous. Later on, it was Kid Presentable. Then Kid Gruesome. And, finally, Kid Moe. Hey, what's this? [Liquid Sloshes] Oh, that- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I've been meanin' to empty that out. You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing. He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King... and he looks just like him too. Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was Gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But, somehow, I just never made it to the big time. Why not? 'Cause I got knocked out 40 times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics. Lousy Democrats. [Marge Groans] Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had... this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're 38 years old, you don't know how to box... and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor. No problemo. A competent doctor! D'oh! Well, sir, you more than meet... every one of this state's requirements to box, wrestle or be shot out of a cannon. [Groans] That's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks. You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "Homer Simpson Syndrome." Oh, why me? Don't worry. It's quite beneficial. Your brain is cushioned by a layer of fluid one eighth of an inch thicker than normal. It's almost as if you're wearing a football helmet inside your own head. Why, I could wallop you all day with this surgical two-by-four without ever knocking you down. But I have other appointments. All right, Homer. Let's see the left. [Grunts] Okay. Let's see the right. [Panting] Just a second. When you're ready. All right, I'm ready. Wait a minute. All right. Wait a minute. Just a sec. Okay, punching isn't your thing, but that's okay. You're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from over-punching. Then I can just push him over. That's right. And if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a couple of times. Who's gonna knock you down? No one! When are you gonna fight back? Never! What are you gonna do? Nothin'! That's my boy! Man, you'd never get me into a ring. Boxing causes brain damage. Okay, you're fightin' a guy named Boxcar Bob. Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he? Uh, no, not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fightin' for a sandwich. Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with 'em than I did. Gee, thanks, Moe. What's this? Ah, that's the barbed wire. [Chuckles] We, uh-We called that "the stinger." They don't let you use that no more.

Well, the fans are weary of fights that are over... before they have an opportunity to even get drunk. I just need a body who can sustain verticality for three rounds. Yeah, but Homer's no boxer.

#08x04 - Burns, Baby Burns^What a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day. I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside... watching the seventh game of the World Series. Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today. And the cider mill operated continuously until 1941... when its workers left to fight in the Second World War. When they returned, the old girl was just as they'd left her... only now she was infested with thousands upon thousands of rats. [All Gasping, Reacting] Right. And if you listen real carefully... you can still hear them gnawing away at the apples... and splashing around in the toilets. And that concludes this portion of the tour. [Change Rattling] One of the most historically significant fruit presses... in this part of the state- [Sighs] was based on a German design, but modified for the larger American apple. Well, if God didn't make little green apples, it's Homer Simpson. How long have you been here? Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life. Oh, sucking down the cider, huh? Hey, word to the wise- season pass. Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference... between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now, here's a little trick to help you remember. If it's clear and yella, you've got juice there, fella. If it's tangy and brown, you're in cider town. Now, there's two exceptions and it gets kind of- [Fades] [Homer Thinking] Oh! You can stay, but I'm leaving. [Continues, Indistinct] And of course in Canada, the whole thing's flip-flopped. Oh, my! I better get you some cider. Next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. Just look at all this beautiful "foilage." It's not "foilage," Mom. It's foliage. Foliage. That's what I said- "foilage." It doesn't take a "nucular" scientist to pronounce "foilage." [Wind Whistling] Honestly, Smithers, I don't know why Harvard even bothers to show up. They barely even won. Their cheating was even more rampant than last year, sir. Well, I say let Harvard have its football and academics. Yale will always be first in gentlemanly club life.

It was rough, I tell you. Careful of the apple pie on the seat. Uh-oh. Grampa, are you sitting on the pie? I sure hope so. Hey, I'm looking for this guy. Anybody know who he is? Yeah, sure, we know him. That's Mr. Burns. He tried to kill our puppies. He sexually harassed me. He stole my fiancée. He made fun of my weight. Okay, so there's been a little friction. Know his address? Whoa! This guy's got more bread than a prison meat loaf. He's rich, I tell ya. I never seen a place with a walk-in mailbox. Hey, who am I talking to? [Doorbell Rings] Yes? Yeah. Uh, hi. My-My name is Larry. I'm here to see Mr. Burns. Well, I hate to break it to you, Larry... but if Mr. Burns ever wants to see a stranger... he will observe him through a powerful telescope. Now, if you- Smithers, what's going on? How dare you interrupt my lime rickey? [Slurping, Sighs] State your business. Well, geez! I'm a little nervous here. What I'm trying to say is I'm- You're what? Selling light bulbs? Worried about the whales? Keen on Jesus? Out with it! Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son. Oh, and I stepped on one of your peacocks. You got a paper towel? It's true. He is my son. Hey, now you're talking! Good God. Ah, Pop, don't get me wrong. It's great to be here. But how's a guy like you wind up with a son like me? Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times. It was 1941, the- No, '39, my 25th Yale reunion. [Burns Narrating] Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years- Mimsie Bankcroft. Of course by then, Mimsie had her share of wrinkles... and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections... to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily. I took Lily to the local "cinematorium'... where our passions were inflamed by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word "damn. '" We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum. There, under the smiling eyes of four stuffed Eskimos... we expressed our love physically... as was the style at the time. [Guffaws] Well, how do you like that? I have been in a museum. What happened with you and Ma? There was a terrible scandal. Lily's family forced her to give you up... and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas. I never heard from her again. But I prattle on. Tell me everything about your life. Oh, what's to tell? I was at the orphanage till I was 18. Then I got my job at the souvenir stand. Oh, and once I saw a blimp. Well, you must be tired. Let me show you your room. Oh, is this posh! Ah, Pop, nobody's ever been so nice to me. Yes, yes. All right. Uh-huh. It's good to see you too. Now then, in case you get bored, here's the playroom. You can't just eat the orange and throw the peel away! A man's not a piece of fruit! This show was supposed to close last week! Close this show! Close it, I say. Hey, don't worry about it. You're all right. [Bird Squawks] [Snoring, Mumbles] [Snoring] [Both Scream] Hey, you're that hitchhiker. What are you doing here? Learning the family business. I'm Larry Burns, the boss's son. Uh-oh. Oh, relax. I don't wanna work. I'm so lazy I took lessons on a player piano. Wow! That's really lazy. Lazy, you're not kidding. Why, I'm like a rug on Valium. I'm talking lazy. So lazy. And Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry. I think we've heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening. Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today. ♪ [Ballroom] [Chattering, Laughing] Hey, Pop, this crowd is pretty swanky. I'm not gonna fit in here. Nonsense, Larry. Your blood is bluer than any of theirs. Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm. Oh, Admiral Carstairs, I'd like you to meet my son, Larry. Hey, Skipper, good to meet you. Where'd you start out, on the Merrimack? Hey, I should talk. I hope I look that good when I'm 200. That's such insubordination! Larry, please. He's very sensitive about his age. Oh, Monty, this must be the son I've heard so much about. Larry, you must meet our daughter, the debutante. She came out last spring. Whoa! Put her back in! She's not done yet. [Scoffs] Smithers, there's something a bit odd about young Larry. I can't quite put my finger on it. Well, he is a bit rough around the edges, sir. One might blame his truly heroic intake of cocktails. Pull up a seat, Pop. You too, Chuckles. I mean, the food ain't great, but the portions are terrific. Hey, I'm kidding. Relax. Hey, give my regards to Mrs. Boyardee. [Shudders] A total lack of refinement. Smithers, send for the boys at Yale admissions, hmm? Well, did you meet Larry? Oh, yes. He made light of my weight problem... then suggested my motto should be "Semper Fudge." At that point he told me to "relax." How were his test scores? Let's just say this- he spelled "Yale" with a six. I see. Well, l- Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation. I wonder how much I should give. Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's would call for a very generous contribution. For example, a score of 400 would require a donation of new football uniforms. Three hundred- a new dormitory. And in Larry's case, we would need an international airport. Yale could use an international airport, Mr. Burns. Are you mad? I'm not made of airports! Get out! Summon my son at once. Uh, it appears he's gone drinkin', sir. [Scoffs] Everybody, go nuts. I'm buyin'! Hey, handsome, send the bill to my dad. Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill. Yeah, but it was worth it. [Burps] Hey, what's everybody in this burg have against my dad? He's a pussycat. I tell you, he's a doll-baby. Come on over. I'll show you.

Make with the yakety-yak-yak. Oh, yakety-yak-yak. You, food bag, do you have a son? Yes, sir, I do. And is he a constant disappointment? Does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them? Oh, all the time. Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who- Fascinating. Good night. Dad, what's with you tonight? I mean, I'm getting frostbite over here. I'll tell you what's with me- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish ignoramus for a son. Uh, I should go. What's the matter, Pop? Don't you love me anymore? [Door Slams Shut] Oh. [Grumbling] Geez! Dad and I, we started out great... but now it's falling apart, like a Chinese motorcycle. It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for. Yeah. I tell ya, I don't get no regard. No regard at all. No esteem either. Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you... and that is a phony kidnapping. Yeah, right. I don't know. Maybe I should just leave town. Phony kidnapping. Nah. I know what I gotta do. I gotta clean up my act. No more joking around all the time. No more slacking off at work. And most important, no more booze. [Glass Breaks] I know I can do it. "Your son has been kidnapped." I can't believe someone would kidnap my Larry. I won't rest until he's returned to me. Not to be impertinent, sir... but didn't you want Larry out of your life as recently as two hours ago? It's the principle, Smithers. Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns... whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son. All right, Mr. B., when the kidnappers call with the ransom demand... you tell them you'll leave the money under the big net in the park. And then down comes the net. Right, Chief? Hey, I like it. I like it a lot. [Birds Twittering] Hmm? Hmm? [TV, Indistinct] What are you doing in the basement? It's like you're hiding out down here. Hiding out? [Raspberry] Marge, you've been reading too many "hide out" books. And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us? Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis. He's not a drifter, Mom. That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry. He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles. Hey! How you doing? Ooh, look at your hair. What happened? You saw yourself in a mirror? He's kidding, Mom. But, seriously, I'd love to have hair like yours. I just can't get the zoning permits. Hey, that reminds me, Mom. Buckingham Palace called. They want their hat back. [Groans] Hey, kids, how about a hand for your mom? She's all right. Yeah, Mom! All right, Mom! Oh, yeah. Thank you. [Ringing] Ahoy, hoy? Hello, Mr. Burns. This is the kidnapper. [Chuckling] Do you miss your son? Yes, I'm missing one son. Return it immediately. If you really love Larry, prove it, and you can have him back today. Whoa! How much proof do you need? Five thousand, six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got. Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money. More important than money? Who is this? Uh- Uh, just a second. [Dial Tone] Beautiful. Eddie, did you trace the phone number? Sure did, Chief. 555- Oh, geez, that's gotta be phony. Hey, I think I got a pai gow. [Groans] I hate pai gow! Can't we just play "quang jong"? Can't we just go upstairs? No! This is Kent Brockman in Chopper Copter 6 with a special report. Montgomery Burns's son has been kidnapped. Kidnapped?

I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now... before you get in a lot of trouble. What, but, but- Marge, it's broad daylight, and there's cops everywhere. No excuses. Just do it.

I mean, Homer's no kidnapper. Well, he's the best friend I ever had. We faked the whole thing. [Chattering] I should've known. You're the only one stupid enough to kidnap you. Now, get down here so I can spank you in front of this gawking rabble. Smithers, take off my belt. With pleasure, sir. Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping. But is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love. I'm a father myself, sir. And, sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring, or stinky. But they can always count on one thing- their father's unconditional love. [All] Mmm! How about it, Pop? I know it's tough, but can you love me for what I am? [Groans] Well- [Mumbles] There, there, sonny boy. I suppose I have been a bit- Oh, no, I can't do it. It's just not me. I'm sorry, Larry. I can't be the family that you need. Oh, that's okay.

Hey, Lise, check this out. Nonstick coating. Ooh. A punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party? Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor? Well, maybe we could use it once and then return it. Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here. [Groans] [Beeps] ♪ [Humming] Bart, company's coming. Go put doilies under the coasters. Hurry! Hurry! [Dings] Lisa, quick! Screw these back on. Mom, calm down. The party's not for another three hours. Oh, good. That will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham. [Groans] Ohh! Homer! Homer: What? Are you ready? Just gotta put my shoes on. The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on clothes... and you didn't do it. [Doorbell Rings] And now it's too late! They're here! Bart, greet our guests and take their coats. Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat. Should I let him in? My coat was stolen at last week's interfaith banquet. So I helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas. Well, as you can see, we don't believe fur is murder... but paying for it sure is. [Laughing] Uh, sorry we're late. But Luann had to put on her face. She doesn't want anyone to know she's got no eyebrows. What? You don't. [All Laughing] [Chattering] Did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie? You know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella's always in 'em. If you want to talk nervous, you should have seen Kirk deal with the high school boys... who egged our Bonneville. Ha! Should have asked them to hurl some bacon. Then maybe I could have had a decent breakfast for once. You know what you two need? A little comic strip called Love ls. It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married. Mmm! Well, Marge, if that was my last meal... I'd tell the warden, "Bring on the lethal injection!" [Laughing] Yeah, Marge. I know I haven't eaten that well since I was in the army. Or that noisily. All right, that's it. So, who wants to play a game? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Oh, that's a noodle-scratcher. Oh! Cornstarch! Oh, rightio! It's good for keeping down the urges. Oh, come on, Luann. You know what this is. Kirk, I don't know what it is. Oy! It could not be more simple, Luann. Do you want me to show this to the cat and have the cat tell you what it is? 'Cause the cat's gonna get it. I'm sorry. I'm not as smart as you, Kirk. We didn't all go to Gudger College. [Dings] It's dignity! Gah! Don't you even know dignity when you see it? Kirk, you're spitting! Okay, genius, why don't you draw dignity? Oh, that's dignity, all right! That's great! Worthy of Webster's. Well, it's no wonder I can't draw dignity. I gave it up when I married her. Now, Kirk, it's only a game. Sometimes we- Oh, cram it, Churchie! Maybe we should all have a few drinks. I'd have a drink, but it might loosen my tongue. You want to talk? Go ahead, Luann, talk. Why don't you tell them one of your little bedtime stories, huh? Like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser. Or how about the one about how I carry a change purse? Yeah, a purse! Shut up and let the woman talk! Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story. It's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job... as manager of a cracker factory. Homer: Boring! A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence- Ooh! Here we go! sent the number one cracker factory in town... into a tie for sixth with Table Time and Allied Biscuit. [Kirk] You want to hear a secret, everybody? Luann loves it! Loves it when I fail! Oh, yes, Kirk. I love having to borrow money from my sister. I love having to steal clothes from the church donation box. Oh, sweet Jesus!

I'm afraid I'm going to have to amputate your butt. [Imitates Hibbert Laughing] All right, if you think you must. Come on, Milhouse. We are going. Oh, can't I come home later? There's not going to be a home later. Oh, okay. Ta-ta! I'm off to the beauty salon! Good night. Thanks for coming. We'll see you. Bye-bye. Well, I think that went pretty well. [Tires Screeching] What? I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party. Marge, please. That was 20 minutes ago. I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They were so insulting- "You are a coward." No one likes to hear that after a nice meal. You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on. You know who the real victim is in all this- Milhouse. Hey, Van Houten, I heard your folks broke up. Aren't you gonna say "Ha-ha"? Oh, by no means. My dad left my mom after she got hooked on cough drops. By the end, her breath was so fresh... she wasn't really my mother anymore. Oh. So I guess I'm not alone. Aw, you'll do fine. My divorce was tough on my kid, but he got over it. I sleep in a drawer. ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Humming] ♪ [Humming Continues] I must say, Luann, you're really handling this splendidly. From now on, forget everything you thought you knew about Luann Van Houten. Actually, Luann, I don't really know anything about you. Forget it! She's gone! Presto change-o! Kaboom! Sweet Fanny Adams! Bye-bye! Uh, singles life is great, Homer. I can do whatever I want. Today I drank a beer in the bathroom. The one down the hall? Yeah. And another great thing- you get your own bed. Uh, I sleep in a racing car. Do you? I sleep in a big bed with my wife. Oh, yeah. [Knocking] Hey, there, Kirk. Oh, boy! What's going on? Patio party? Nah. A possum drowned in the pool. You have any garbage bags? Ah, just throw it over the fence. Let Arby's worry about it. That's Jerry. He's a major player down at the sewing store. Well, thanks for introducing me. Ah, don't worry, Homer. You know me. And I'm a superstar at the cracker factory. [Kirk] You're letting me go? Kirk, crackers are a family food. Happy families. Maybe single people eat crackers. We don't know. Frankly, we don't want to know. It's a market we can do without. So that's it after 20 years- so long, good luck? I don't recall saying "good luck." [Imitating Engine] And the winner of the Milhouse 500 is Milhouse! [Luann] Milhouse, are you sure you want to drive that inside? Yes! Okay. Be careful, sweet, sweet treasure. [Doorbell Rings] God, I missed you, Lulu. [Giggles] Chase, it's only been three hours. Who's Chase? Oh, that's Mom's new boyfriend. Hey, I know you from American Gladiators. You're Pyro!

Let's roll. ♪ [Whistling] Ow! Ow! Ow! What the hell is wrong with you? Gee! Sorry! It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer. Marge: Homer, get ready! For what? Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray. I don't want to go to that. You said you'd do it as a favor to me. That doesn't sound like something I'd say. Fine. I'll go without you. Okay. Love ya! [Door Slams Shut] Homer, I want you to meet my new special lady. Say hello to Starla. [Cigarette Hisses] [Gulping] Can I have the keys to the car, lover? I feel like changing wigs. Oh, okay. Starla's a temp at KZUG, radio 530. She's gonna help me launch my singing career. [Tires Screeching] My car! Oh, my demo tape! "Can I Borrow a Feeling?" [Laughing] "Can I Borrow a Feeling?" It's your picture on the front. Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me. I already did. [Sighs] You know why all this happened, don't ya? 'Cause I took my marriage for granted. You know, in 12 years, I never once helped out with the housework. Oh, yeah, you gotta do that. I could have at least stayed in shape for her. Oh, and for yourself. I could have taken just a little time to- to make her feel special. It can't just be s*x. It can't! God, I was so self-centered! No wonder I didn't see it coming. That's how it is though. One day your wife is making you your favorite meal... the next day, you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink. Oh, that's tough, pal. But it's never gonna happen to me. Well, how do you know? What makes you guys so special? 'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken- a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine. Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner. "Dear Homer." Ahh. "Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink." [Screams] Hi, Dad. You know, there's buns in the cabinet. Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old, and I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you... but you've got to save my marriage! Oh, okay? Can I stay up? All right. [Clears Throat] As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately. And I think your mom might not be happy with me. You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now? Because there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about! You mean, like your poker shack out in the swamp? Mm-hmm. She knows. Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino tojoin- Homer. and- Marge. in holy matrimony.

Levis. Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans? You're very lucky to have Mom. That's your advice? Go to bed! [Footsteps] Good morning! You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests. So I wandered over to that theater you went to last night... and I bought tickets to their entire season. Look, "Mostly Madrigal. '" Uh, that might be good. Oh! Oh, "A n Evening with Philip Glass. '"Just an evening? "Voices of the Elderly, '"[/i] or- Hmm. Homie, I appreciate this.

Yes, we do! I got us a divorce this afternoon. What? I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real.

#08x07 - Lisa's Date With Density^Skinner! Uh, Superintendent Chalmers. [Panting] What's wrong? Nothing. I just bought myself a car. Oh. Oh, good. This will sound crazy, but at first... I thought I'd enraged you again. Skinner! What? What? Uh, you're getting paranoid. I used to think a car was just a way of getting... from point "A" to point "B"- and on weekends point "C." But that was the old me. That man died the moment I laid eyes on the 1979 Honda Accord. I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself as soon as I finish paying off Mother.

Well, Seymour, I make superintendent money... which amply covers both food and car. l- Holy jumping Caesar's catfish! My "H'"has been stolen! Oh! That's how people know it's a Honda!

This way. Uh-oh. [Cash Register Dings] [Chuckles] [Whistles] Eh, morning, Apu. Good morning. One doughnut with sprinkles, and- [Gasps] Wait a minute. These are not sprinkles, sir. What do you mean? You've clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them... on top of the doughnut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles. Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was! A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle. A Twizzler is not a sprinkle. AJolly Rancher is not a sprinkle, sir. Perhaps in Shangri-la they are, but not here. Oh. [Bell Dings] [Apu] Thank you. Come again.

How does Bart do this every week? Hey, brainiac, since when do you get detention? It's your fault. I accidentally laughed at your immature prank. Ha! Yeah. The best part was when he got wet. Hey, you're doing that the stupid way. If you use that deal with the five chalks, you'll get done faster. Thanks, but I prefer the honest way. Whatever. Smell you later. Hmm. Wow. That was a good idea. And I can't believe it came from Nelson. [Grunting] [Thinking] He's not like anybody I've ever met. He's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest.

You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest. Um-There's, uh, niceness to it. I was foolish to think I'd actually changed you. Maybe I was seeing things in you that weren't really there. Definitely. Then why did you want to be with me? Mmm-mmm. Maybe 'cause you were the first person... that ever thought there was a nice guy inside me. Huh. Well, guess you really blew that one, huh? Well, I guess this is it. You mean, like, good-bye? Let's just call it "smell you later." [Sniffing] [Bell Rattling] Hi, Lisa. Could I talk to you, or will that just make Nelson whale on me again? Don't worry. Nelson and I don't like each other anymore. [Gasps] Really? You got anybody in mind for your next crush? Well, I'm really not thinking about that now. I suppose it could be almost anybody. Yes! Yes! [Dialing] [Line Ringing] [Homer's Voice] Hello. This is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. Happy Dude. The court has ordered me to call every person in town... to apologize for my telemarketing scam. I'm sorry. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me... send one dollar to Sorry Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. You have the power.
#08x08 - Hurricane Neddy^Pressure dropping, humidity rising over (0%, increasing wind? Here we are. Chapter 2. "So your pressure is dropping." [Gasps] Dad, wake up! [Muttering] What? I think a hurricane is coming! Oh, Lisa! There's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield. Yes, but the records only go back to 1978... when the hall of records was mysteriously blown away. [Whining] What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies? [Yipes] Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know. And the weather service has warned us to brace ourselves for the onslaught... of Hurricane Barbara. And if you think naming a destructive storm after a woman is sexist... you obviously have never seen the gals grabbing for items at a clearance sale. [Groans] That's true, but he shouldn't say it. We better pick up some supplies. Stand behind the flaming garbage cans. We'll be letting you into the store 70 people at a time. Let's just beat him up and take his stuff! No, no, no! Do not listen to that man. Remain calm. You will all have a chance to be gouged. [Relieved Sighing] Thank goodness! [Crowd Yelling] Whoa! [Chattering] Oh, there's so little left. "Creamed Eels"? "Corn Nog'"? "Wadded Beef.'" Mom, let's just grab what we can and get out ofhere. This storm is making people crazy. The last pineapple! And plenty ripe too! But I'm not fruit! I'm a kid! That's what the pumpkin said. Hi, Lisa. We're going to be in a pie! Sir, for your own safety, we do advise you to evacuate. I ain't leaving! I was born in this nursing home... and I'll die in this nursing home! Is there any chance of you changing your mind? Sure. Let's go. Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks... should come over and hunker in our bunker. Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old canceled checks... and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra. I'm sure I'd be a third wheel. Oh, no, siree. We'd be happy as hens to have you- I would make it my business to be a third wheel. Okilly-dokilly. Ooh! I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage. Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar. ♪ [Chorus Singing] [Thunderclap] [Clock Chimes] [People Yelling] Awesome! So long, suckers! [Disappointed Sigh] [All Cheering] Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm? Ooh, a Rubik's Cube! Let's all work it together. Okay, start with diagonal colors. Homer: Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger... on the orange side, and turn it. My main finger? [All Talking At Once] You gotta start backwards! [Talking Continues] Alternate corners. One at a time! Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise! Now I remember why I put this down here in the first place! [Electricity Buzzing] [Thunderclap] ♪ [Harmonicas] ♪ [Harpsichords: Dissonant] It's dying down. All clear, everyone! Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane. Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is? See? I told you it was over. Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being there- [Screams] [Yelling] [All Yelling] Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family... we will be forever grateful... and recommend you to all our friends. So, if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to- Wait! Listen, everybody. The hurricane's over. He fell for it! Way to go, Marge! Remarkable. There doesn't seem to be any damage at all. It just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith. It's all gone. Everything... gone-diddilly-on. Maude? Rod? Todd? I'm right here, Daddy. Oh, Neddy, it was terrifying. I thought I was headed for the eternal bliss of paradise. Oh, my gosh! Look at Rod! I have a headache! [Grunting] Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for. Now, that kind of attitude's not gonna get your house back. I'm sure your insurance will cover the house. Oh, well, no. Neddy doesn't believe in insurance. He considers it a form of gambling. You know, it's kind of funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left. Well, call us if you need anything. We got new clothes from the donation bin. I'm a surfer! Look, Daddy. Todd is stupid, and I'm with him. And now Mommy's stupid! [Laughs] Looking good, Rod. Looking good. [Sighs] Neddy, I know this has been a terrible day... but, by golly, first thing tomorrow... we're going to open up the Leftorium... and before you know it, we'll be back on our feet. Down here at Springfield Mall, a storm-addled crowd... appears to have turned its rage on the Leftorium. [Chattering] Surprisingly, people are grabbing things with both hands... suggesting it's not just southpaws in this rampaging mob. Ohh! Start looking in the back. Meantime, Springfield bowlers will be happy to hear... that the Bowlarama is back in business at its new location... teetering over the Carter Dixon Tunnel. [Pins Crashing] [People Cheering] Reverend Lovejoy... with all that's, uh, happened to us today, uh... you know, l-I kind of feel like Job. Well, aren't you being a tad melodramatic, Ned? Also, I believe Job was right-handed. But, Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me? Ooh! Short answer- yes, with an "if." Long answer- no, with a "but." If you need additional solace, by the way... I've got a copy of something or other by Art Linkletter in my office. Even in my darkest hour, I can turn to the Good Book for- [Groans] Son of a gun-diddilly-un! Those gilded edges smart. Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says! Even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! What more could I do? [Stammering] I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I just can't... dang-diddily-do-dang, do-dang-diddily-darn do it! l-l-l- [Sighs] Ned, Maude, you've got to go back to your house! Something incredible has happened! Oh, what happened now? Did the rubble burn down? No! Come on! [All] Yea! [Gasps] Oh, they rebuilt our house! Oh, it's a miracle! I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it... practically all of Springfield was offering to help. Mm-hmm. My pleasure. Happy to help. Fabulous experience. Sure! Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how... but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love. And a cement mixer full of hope and some cement. Oh, it's wonderful! l-l- I don't know how I can possibly repay you. But if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield! No, no, not me, friends. He's talking about himself. But thanks for looking! Mmm. [All Cheering] The living room and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining. Uh-huh. And- Oh! Looks like a loose nail. Eh, one out of 25 ain't bad. Your beautiful kitchen, Ned, just as you remember it. Was that, uh-Was that toilet always next to the refrigerator? [Laughs] Ned, you ever try lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs? Lisa and I built your room. But I don't like this clown. Uh, I wouldn't take it down if I were you. It's a load-bearing poster. [Electricity Buzzing] Now, this is a room with electricity... but it has too much electricity. So I don't know. You might want to wear a hat. Uh-huh. [Scraping Sound] Floor feels a little gritty here. Yeah. We ran out of floorboards there, so we painted the dirt. Pretty clever! Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway. Come on in! It's your master bedroom! Ow! My nose! Well, I've seen about enough. So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built? Aw, shoot! [Sighs] [Sighs, Blows] [Glass Shatters] Ohhh! Now, calm down, Neddilly-diddilly-diddilly-diddilly-diddilly. They did their best. Shodilly-idilly-iddilly-diddilly. Gotta be nice. Hostility-diddilly-diddilly-diddilly- Aw, hell! Diddily-ding-dong crap! Can't you morons do anything right? [All Gasping] Hey! Ned, we meant well. And everyone here tried their best. Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family's out of control, but we can't blame you... because you have good intentions! Hey, back off, man! Oh, okay, dude! I wouldn't want you to have a cow, man! Here's a catchphrase you better learn for your adult years: "Hey, buddy, got a quarter?" [All Gasping, Chattering] I am shocked and appalled. Mr. Flanders, with all due respect... Bart didn't do anything. [Gasps] Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson... Springfield's answer to a question no one asked! [Laughing] What do we have here? The long flabby arm of the law? The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars! Mallomars. Oh, that's going in the act. Oh, yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you, I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk! Hey, I've only been here a few minutes. What's going on? You ugly, hate-filled man! Hey- Hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I've, um- What was the third thing you said? Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met. Hey, I got off pretty easy. [Murmuring] Neddy, uh, wait. Where you goin'? [Car Radio On] ♪ [Man Singing On Radio] ♪ [Humming Along] ♪ [Continues in Hawaiian] ♪ [Gibberish] I just attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself. Very well. Shall I show you to your room, or would you prefer... to be dragged off kicking and screaming? Ooh, kicking and screaming, please. As you wish. Noooooo! Flanders? Ned Flanders? I'd better call Dr. Foster. [Ringing] Yes. Dr. Foster here. Ned Flanders? You're sure? No, no, no. I'll come right over. And may God have mercy on us all. Darling, there's an emergency at the hospital. Where are my shoes? Oh, I think they're in the den. In the den? May God have mercy on us all. Well, how are you feeling this evening? Uh- Actually, I'm a little chilly. Can I have another straitjacket? Of course. Thank you. Dr Foster? Hmm. At least your memory's not crazy. Now, Ned, you may remember... we spent some time together 30 years ago. Do you recall what you were like back then? Oh, sure. I was a good little boy. Were you? Whee, I'm Dick Tracy! Bam! [Yelling] Take that, Prune Face! Now I'm Prune Face! Take that, Dick Tracy! Now I'm Prune Tracy! [Groaning] Take that, Dick- Ned, stop it at once! Stop it! [Yelling] I can't believe I was such a terror. Well, neither could your parents. That's why they brought you to me. Well, I'm afraid young Ned is unusually aggressive... but I can't seem to find a cause for it. [Clattering] Hey! Hey! Get down from that bookshelf, please! Most of those books haven't been discredited yet. Would you please tell your son to stop? We can't do it, man! That's discipline. That's like telling Gene Krupa not to go- [Imitating Drums] [Drums Continues, Imitates Cymbals] Hmm. Lack of discipline. I'm beginning to see the problem. We don't believe in rules. Like, we gave them up when we started living like freaky beatniks. You don't believe in rules, yet you want to control Ned's anger. Yeah. You've gotta help us, Doc. We've tried nothing, and we're all out of ideas. Hmm. There is an experimental therapy... that might help Ned contain his anger. [Dr. Foster] It was known as the University of Minnesota Spankelogical Protocol. And that's just about eight months, mmm, now. Well, Ned, how do you feel? I feel... fine. You don't feel... angry? Absotively not-arino! How do you feel about me? Pretty darn diddilly-doodilly good! The only problem with the treatment was that it worked too well. You became unable to express any anger at all. From that point on, any time you felt angry... you could only respond with a string of nonsensical jabbering. Well, I'll be darn-diddilly-arned! Yeah, that's the stuff. You suppressed your rage for so long... it finally erupted as a massive public explosion. It sure did-diddilly-id. All right, all right. Just watch it there. I'm here to help, you know. Now, I'd like to try something. Is there any person who makes you particularly angry? [Ringing] Y'ello. Yes! Mental hospital? I don't know any Ned Flanders. The man who lived next door until his house blew down? Oh, him! Mr Simpson? Dr. Foster. Please come with me. You folks are free to roam the grounds. Just remember, one of our patients is a cannibal. Try to guess which one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. [Muttering] Man: Everyone outside of this room is against me! I can hear you walking by- It stinks! It stinks! It stinks! Yes, Mr. Sherman. Everything stinks. We want to teach Ned to release his anger in healthy doses. [Chewing Loudly] We need someone so irritating... that Ned simply will not be able to repress his rage. Homer, can you be that annoying? l-What? Get in the booth. "Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others." [Laughs] Well, howdy, Homer. Ooh, thanks for dropping by. Mmm, he's not responding. Proceed to level two- antagonism. "Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent." Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder. Ooh! Thanks for dropping by. Aw, he's still repressing. Maximum hostility factor. "I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other." Now, that's psychiatry! Huh? Huh? [Laughs] Very funny, wise guy. Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron, and he just sits there grinning moronally. Hi, neighbor. You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human. Oh, now, why would I be afraid of that? Because humans are obnoxious sometimes, humans hate things. Well, maybe a few of them do... back east. I can't find what Homer's saying. Did you write that? Um, did you like it? Come on, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites? Mm-mmm. Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm, satisfying. What about, uh, fluorescent lights? Ooh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you got a fluorescent light. See? You like everything! N-No, that's not true. l-l-l- I don't like the service at the post office. You know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then they've got those machines in the lobby. They're faster. No help there. You might even say... I hate the post office. That and my parents. Lousy beatniks. Hey, that felt good. He just said he hates his parents. Do you know what that means? Um, what do you think? It means he's cured. That's what I said. Woman: There he is! - [People Cheering] Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger until I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it! All right! [All Cheering] Yes, that's very healthy, Ned. And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car. Yeah, uh- Um- Oh! Oh! [Laughs] Ned, you're so crazy.

I gotta get some fresh air. [Gasps] No, Homie. Wait. What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from me? What's that smell? Onions. Chili powder. Cumin. Juicy ground chuck! It's chili!

Oh, some must be doubles. "Oregano"? What the hell? Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy! Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face. Fine.

I hate this place! Why am I here? [Male Voice] You are on a quest for knowledge. Who said that? Huh? Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide. Hiya. There is a lesson you must learn. If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of ya. No. I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away... with a thousand thoughts at once. Yeah. That's me all right. [Wind Howling] Clarity is the path to inner peace. But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions? Are you kiddin'? [Chuckles] If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer. You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey. And I was-was- [Growling] Hey! Knock it off! Sorry. [Chuckles] I am a coyote. Look. Just give me some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya! Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well. To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate. Soul mate? Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond. A profound mystical understanding. That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie! My soul mate is Marge. Is it? Hmm? Hey, wait. Come back! [Groans] Oh. [Horn Tooting] [Screams] A ghost train!

Maybe the desert was just this sand trap. Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the pro shop. And that talkin' coyote was really just a talkin' dog. Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate. Hey. Wait a minute! There's no such thing as a talkin' dog. [Barks] Damn straight. So then I says to Mabel. I says- Hi, kids. I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad. Where's your mother? Out back. So, anyway, I says to Mabel. I says- Hi, honey. Oh, I guess you're cranky... because I didn't come home last night. I'm cranky... because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer. Oh, honey. I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. [Wind Howls] Come on. You gotta believe me. You're my soul mate. Don't soul mate me! Okay. That coyote said my soul mate would understand me. But Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common. Look at these records. Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers. Now look at her records. They stink! Oh. Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason. Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here. I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking? This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir. Now, if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave. Hey, Barney, soul mate! Let me buy you a beer. Okay. But I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum. What about you, Lenny? I'm a crony. Carl? I'd say acquaintance. Colleague. Sympathizer. Compadre. Associate. Contemporary.

And then I saw the lighthouse... and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron. Or that little guy on the Don't Walk sign. Yeah. Wow, Marge. You really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because- We had a fight? Right. And we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus- And you're from Mars. Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters. Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin deep. But our "sames" go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a- A profound, mystical understanding? Hey! We do! Oh, Marge! We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote! Space coyote? [Ship Horn Blows] Oh, my God! The ship! [Marge Gasps] We'll all be killed! The light! We gotta get the light back on! Jonathan Livingston Seagull! We're on a collision course! Hard to starboard! Uh, port? Aye. Port. They see us. They're starting to turn. We did it! We sure did... soul mate. Mmm! [Chattering Excitedly] [Whistles] Look at all them hot pants. Hey! [Recites Lyric]
#08x10 - The Springfield Files^Hello. I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is no. Our story begins on a Friday morning... in a little town called Springfield. T.G.I. F! Guys, I'm off to Moe's. But, Homer, it's 10:00 in the morning. Don't worry. I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around the city... keeping its speed over 50. And if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called The Bus that Couldn't Slow Down. First, I hook this common VCR... into the security camera system like so. Then I insert this old videotape of us working... on a continuous loop. [No Audible Dialogue] So, another Friday is upon us. What will you be doing, Smithers? Something gay, no doubt? What? What? You know, lighthearted, fancy-free. Mothers, lock up your daughters. Smithers is on the town. Exactly, sir. Thank God it's Wednesday! It's Friday. Uh-oh. Wrong pills. Uh, little help? Sorry, Donkey Kong. You are just not a draw anymore. Hey, he's still got it! [Coins Clattering] Thirty-eight, 39, 40 quarters. This better be good. [Computerized Voice] Game over. Please deposit 40 quarters. What a rip! Thank God it's Friday. ♪ [Humming] Hello. Hello? [Santa's Little Helper Growling] Bad dog! [Snowball Yowling] Bad cat! Bad fawn. Hmm. Shoo! Shoo! All right! It's time for ABC's T.G.I.F. line-up. Lise, when you get a little older, you'll learn that Friday's just another day... between NBC's Must-See Thursday and CBS's Saturday night crap-o-rama. Another Duff, Homer? Nah. It's Friday night, Moe. I wanna try something special. Uh, sure. Sure. Here you go. Düff, from Sweden. Go! Wait a minute! This is Duff! [Chuckles] Ya got me, didn't ya? All right. Here you go. Red Tick Beer. Hmm. Bold, refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on. [Dogs Barking] Hmm. Needs more dog. [Men Snoring] Well, it's 1:00 a.m. Better go home... and spend some quality time with the kids. Just a second. You gotta take a Breathalyzer test before I let you drive home. [Beeping] Uh, I guess I'll walk home. [Moaning] [Dog Barking] ♪ [Eerie] [Sighs] [Panting, Whimpering] [Screams] [Screams] [Gasps] Oh, Son, I'm glad to see ya! I went for the morning paper and I got lost! No time for you, old man. [Hooting] [Gasps] Please, don't hurt me. [High-pitched] Don't be afraid. [Screaming] [Panting] Homer, it's 2:00 a.m. What happened? It was an alien! It appeared in front of me and said, "Don't be afraid"! Have you been drinking? No! Well, 10 beers. [Groans] I'm telling you I saw a creature from another planet. Maybe you just dreamed it. Oh, yeah? When I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo. Explain that. More sausage? [Moaning] Dad, according to Junior Skeptic Magazine, the chances are a 175 million-to-one... of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours. So? It's just the people who claim they've seen aliens... are always pathetic lowlifes with boring jobs. Oh. And you, Dad. [Chuckles] I am the thing from Uranus! [Gasps] Oh, it's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked by my own children on my birthday. It's your birthday? Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's. Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? Oh. We gotta get you a present. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We love you, boy. Good doggy. Good doggy. Lousy lovable dog. Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold, metal table... and prodded me with humiliating probes. And then- Oh, wait. That was my physical. [All Scoff] Great story, Homer. Really. The alien has a sweet, heavenly voice, like Urkel. And he appears every Friday night... like Urkel! Well, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass- I mean, Simpson. So, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. ♪ [Humming] You don't have to humiliate me. I just torched a building downtown and I'm afraid I'll do it again! Yeah, right. I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. ♪ [Humming] Fruitcake. Look at this, Scully. There's been another unsubstantiated U.F.O. sighting in the heartland of America. We've gotta get there right away. Well, gee, Mulder. There's also this report of a shipment of drugs... and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight. I hardly think the F.B.I.'s concerned with matters like that. Hello. Can I help you? Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I. [Gasps] Is this about that pen that I took from the post office? I swear, I didn't know I put it in my purse! Then I was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up. And that just made things worse. [Hyperventilating] Actually, we're here to see your husband about his U.F.O. encounter. Oh. Come- Come in. Mr. Simpson, look at this lineup and tell us if any of these are the aliens you saw. Yo! No, I'm sorry. This is an outrage dragging me into- Oh, this makes me very angry. Now, we're going to run a few tests. This is a simple lie detector. I'll ask you a few yes or no questions... and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand? Yes. Ow. [Panting] Wait a minute, Scully. What's the point of this test? No point. I just thought he could stand to lose a little weight. His jiggling is almost hypnotic. Yes. It's like a lava lamp. [Mulder] All right, Homer. We want you to re-create your every move the night you saw this alien. Well, the evening began at the gentlemen's club... where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon. Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the F.B.I. We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. You happy? [Drunkenly] You are one fine lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that! I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her! Hey, a penny! So, who are you guys anyhow? Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I. F.B.I., huh? Uh, excuse me. All right, they're on to us! Get him back to Sea World! [Weakly Squealing] So I says, blue M&M, red M&M- they all wind up the same color in the end. Homer, why don't you show us where you went when you left the bar? I was standing right here when the horrible creature emerged from the woods. For the love of God, help me! I've been here for four days and a turtle's got ahold of my teeth! There he is! Come back here, you! Slow down! I'll get ya! [Grunting] This is the worst assignment we've ever had. Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus? Ow! He bit me with my own teeth! No. This is much more irritating. I've seen enough, Mulder. Let's go. Yeah, okay. But somewhere out there, something is watching us. There are alien forces acting in ways we can't perceive. Are we alone in the universe? Impossible when you consider the wonders that exist all around us. Voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia... the unsolved mysteries of Unsolved Mysteries. The truth is out there! [Grunting] Who'd have thought a whale could be so heavy? Geez, it's the feds! [Whale Weakly Squeals] Oh, Marge, I never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say, "I believe you, Homer." I don't believe you, Homer. You do? Oh, Marge! You've made me so happy. [Groans] You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear. Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now. Homer, please! I try to be supportive. But this has gone too far. Please, just let it be. No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed? Please, let's just go to sleep. No. I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling amorous. [Growls] No, I'm not. Well, then, good night. Hey, Dad. What's the word from planet Crackpot? Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me too. Well, actually, Dad, I believe you. You do? Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure. Thank you, Son. Now, do you think you could stop the casual swearing? Hell, yes! That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday, we're going back to the woods. And we're going to find that alien. What if we don't? We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network. [Chuckles] They'll buy anything. Now, Son, they do a lot of quality programming too. I kill me. Bud. Weis. Er. Bud. Weis. Er. Coors. Yo, Dad. Can I have a sip of your beer? Now, Son. You don't wanna drink beer. That's for daddies and kids with fake I.D.'s. Besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story? And that is how much college will cost for Maggie. No! No! No! You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I really had a great time out here. Yeah. Me too. It's him! [High-pitched] I bring you peace. As a representative of planet Earth... let me be the first to say- [Screams] [Screaming] [Gasps] D'oh! He's gone. And we still don't have any proof. Oh, yes, we do. I got it all on tape. Good work, Son! We did it! We did it! And so, from this simple man came the proof... that we are not alone in the universe. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Good night. Man: Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we have 10 minutes left. Oh. Fine. Well, let me just get... uh, something out of my car. [Footsteps Running] [Door Closes] [Car Driving Away] I don't think he's coming back. [Kent Brockman] Tonight on Eyewitness News... a man who's been in a coma for 23 years wakes up. Do Sonny and Cher still have that stupid show? No. She won an Oscar, and he's a congressman. Good night! [Long Continuous Beep] But first, E.T., phone Homer... Simpson, that is. Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape. Local man, Homer Simpson, shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamppost... has given us this videotape. It's a close encounter of the blurred kind. I bring you peace. The alien has appeared in the same Springfield pasture the past two Friday nights. Will it appear again this Friday? The entire Channel 6 news team will be there... except for Phil, the boom mike operator, who's getting fired tomorrow. [Groans] Very unprofessional, Phil. Well, Lise, what do you think about the alien now? I think there must be a more logical explanation. I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape. [Doorbell Rings] Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Dr. Hibbert? Yes. Is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based? Uh, the second one. "Zilliphone." Next question. Is the alien Santa Claus? Uh, yes. Were you on my roof last night stealing my weather vane? This interview is over! I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens. He came in peace, and then died... only to come back to life. And his name was... E.T., the extraterrestrial. [Sniffles] I love that little guy. ♪ [Warming Up] ♪ [Warming Up] [Chattering] Leonard Nimoy? What are you doing here? Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained... cosmic forces shall draw me near. Uh-huh. Hey, Spock! What do you want on your hot dog? Surprise me. Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any "Homer ls A Dope" T-shirts, do you? We sold those out in five minutes. D'oh! Marge, how could you? These shirts are 100% cotton. And look at the fine stitching on "Dope." I'll take two. [Thunder Rumbling] [Gasps] [Screams] Look. There it is. Oh, Homie. Homie, I'm so sorry I doubted you. I bring you love. Is that the love between a man and a woman... or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar? Uh, I bring you love. It's bringing love! Don't let it get away! Break its legs! [All Shouting] Wait! You want an alien? This is your alien! Hello, children. I bring you love. [Gasps] It's a monster! Kill it! Kill it! It's not a monster. It's Mr. Burns. Oh, it's Mr. Burns. Kill it! Kill it! No. No, let me explain. Every Friday evening after work, Mr. Burns undergoes a series of medical treatments... designed to cheat death for another week. First, Mr. Burns's chiropractors perform a slight spinal adjustment. [Bones Cracking] [Groaning] Then a team of doctors administers eye drops... painkillers... [Sighs] and a vocal-cord scraping. Don't worry. You won't feel a thing... till I jam this down your throat. The whole ordeal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disoriented. ♪ [Humming] The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money. But what's with the glowing? Um, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant... has given me a healthy green glow... and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love. I bring you fear, famine, pestilence and- Time for a booster. ♪ [Singing Cheerful Song] ♪ [All Singing Cheerful Song] You said you'd bring them peace and love, and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie. Thanks, Marge. ♪ [Singing Continues] [Roaring] ♪ [Singing Ends] And so concludes our tale. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Good night, and keep watching the skis! Uh, skies.
#08x11 - The Twisted World of Marge Simpson^They say the pancakes here stink. Thank you, Agnes. Let's begin. I'm happy to report that our shares in Dynaflux Unimatics... are up a delicious seven and three-quarters. This means our investment club portfolio has nearly... doubled in value. [Chattering] Oh, that's wonderful. I suggest we pump our profits into some new high-risk ventures. Oh, oh! How about Oklasoft? It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing software company. Um, cushions? Everybody likes to sit on cushions. Children are so fat today. Isn't there some way we can make money off that? There's a franchise fair this weekend. Why don't we buy a business? [Chattering] I never thought of that. I'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. They sound a little risky. Tsk. Oh, Marge. You are such a wet blanket. If we'd listened to you, we wouldn't have sponsored that Mexican wrestler. Yet she still gets to share in all the profits! Is that fair? I guess I'm just not comfortable... with the whole idea of"investing." Mmm. Face it. You can't keep up with the go-go '90s. Well, Marge. You're about as popular as rug burn.

[Sighs] And then they gave me back my $500 investment... and kicked me out of the club. Wait, wait, wait. Back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail? Well, maybe it's all for the best. What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about. Ow! Oh!

[Men Murmuring] [Men Shouting] [Punches Landing] [Screaming] Hey. [Punches Landing] Take that. Take this. Come here, you little squirt. [Fighting Sounds Continue] Homie, maybe we should go inside. But, Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet. Look at him. He's gonna do something... and you know it's gonna be good. [Karate Yell] [Thudding][/i] Aw. You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably. Oh, I don't hate you for failing. I love you for trying. [Yawns] What's going on outside? Oh, it's just a mob war. Go back to sleep, honey. [Punch Landing] Forgiveness, please.
#08x12 - Mountain of Madness^Good morning, sir. Care for some coffee? No. The promise of a new day is more than enough exhilaration for me. [Ticking] [Snoring] Smithers, coffee. Ah! We need some excitement around here. Chinese checkers or domestic, sir? No, no. Something fun. Something the men will enjoy, like a safety drill. But what kind? Uh, "Meltdown Alert"? "Mad Dog Drill"? "Blimp Attack"? Ah! I think a good old-fashioned fire drill today! [Ringing] [Murmuring, Shouting] All right. Popcorn's ready. Hey! That's the fire alarm! We gotta get outta here! Wait for me! Come on! Come on! Come on! [Yelling, Shouting] Get out of my way! [Whimpering] Uh- Uh- Hmm. Mmm. Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire! Is it supposed to take this long? What's a good time for a mass evacuation of the entire plant? Forty-five seconds. What's our time so far? I don't know, sir. This stopwatch only goes up to 15 minutes. Damnation! What kind of slow coaches do I have working for me? Ah. Here comes one of our fellows now. [People Shouting] [Pounding On Door] I think I won, Mr. Burns. Yes, you won, all right. You won more than you bargained for. Whoo-hoo! What a disgraceful display! I've seen more orderly behavior in a Ritz Brothers film. You all need a serious lesson in teamwork. Maybe he does, but I don't. Hey, you take that back! No! You take that back! Hit him, Carl! You too, Lenny! D'oh! So Burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains... to learn about teamwork... which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here. Teamwork is overrated. Huh? Think about it. I mean, what team was Babe Ruth on? Who knows? [Lisa, Marge] Yankees. Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance? Hmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me... and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. But I think we have to go on the retreat anyway. [Engine Sputters Out] [Wind Howling] Well, here we are. All right. Let me start off by telling you... this will not be a walk in the park. This will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. I cannot overemphasize the dangers which- Did you bring your family, Simpson? Uh, yes, sir. I thought I was supposed to. Imbecile! Simpson, your family will have to remain here. Oh, man! Oh! Don't worry, kids. This is a national park. We can have lots of fun. I'm afraid that's no longer true, ma'am. Budget cutbacks have forced us to eliminate anything the least bit entertaining. Well, uh, see ya. Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness... to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. The routes are treacherous, so use your maps. Uh, I lost my map. You haven't been issued a map yet. When you arrive at the cabin, there will be a congratulatory party... with sandwiches and moderately priced champagne. [Applause] Now, as an added incentive... the second-to-last team to arrive at the cabin... will receive an hilarious "World's Worst Employee" trophy. Hey, this sounds like fun. And the last team to arrive will be fired. [Chuckles] Uh-oh. And to show that I'm not playing favorites... both Smithers and I will be participating. Who knows? I might be the unlucky one who gets fired. [Quietly] Not bloody likely. I've placed all your names in this hat. Ooh! Thank you. Now, pair off as I draw your names. Lenny and Carl. Aw, nuts! I mean, um- Aw, nuts! Fong and Sutroy. Kimball and Dawson. Aimee and Drucker. Simpson and... Burns? Oh! [Thinking] Quiet, you fool! You're on the one team that can't possibly be fired. Oh. Sir, this can't be right. You assured me this drawing was rigged so we'd be teammates. Yes. Well, frankly, you've been a bit of a pill lately. Why do we always fight on vacation? Well, there's only one name left. Whoever it is will be paired with me. And that person is... Waylon Smithers. Perfect. That's just perfect! Prepare for the adventure of a lifetime... as you fight for survival against the merciless forces of nature. To your marks! Get set! Go! [All Shouting] Ready, Mr. Burns? [Grunts] One moment. Only who can prevent forest fires? You pressed "You," referring to me. That is incorrect. The correct answer is you. [Grunts] Mom, can Lisa and I play outside away from the bear? Okay. But when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in. Huh? How could you do this to me, Mr. Burns, after all I've done for you? Why, if you were here, I'd kick you right in your bony old behind! [Echoing] Bony old behind! Bony old behind! Bony old behind! Bony old behind! Why, thank you, Simpson. I have been watching my figure. [Sinister Laughter] Lise! Lise! Come here! I found two snowflakes that are exactly alike! Really? Let me see! Ow! Oops. Sorry. Hi, Mr. Smithers. Oh, great. It's the Bobbsey Twins. Well, take your prying eyes elsewhere! Oh, I'm sorry. It hasn't been a good day. If I don't get to the top of the mountain real soon, I could get fired. We'll help you. I have a watch with a minute hand. All right, you can come. What time is it? 12:80. No, wait. Wait. What comes after 12? One. No. After 12. [Groans] Tell me, Simpson... if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut... you wouldn't be averse to taking it, would you? Oh, not as such. Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days... about so-called cheating. Yes. A lot of hysteria. Mm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way... it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift? Or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say cheating is a gift man gives himself. Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat. Excellent. And to do so... I propose we travel by... horseless sleigh. Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns. Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met. No, sir, I am not. Bart? Lisa? Hello? [Projector Whirring] [Man On Film] The story of our national parks begins in I (72. Perhaps we should let John Muir tell the tale. [Man 2 Muttering Unintelligibly On Film] Excuse me, sir? I can't find my children. Have you checked the woods? No. Hmm. Follow me. We'll take the chairlift. It'll give us... an eagle-eye view of the area directly beneath the chairlift. Ooh! Well, I won't lie to you, ma'am. Our chances of finding your children are slim to nil. Lisa: Hi, Mom! Marge: There they are! Let me down here. Sorry. There's no way off till we get to the top. And even then, it's sort of tricky. [Groaning] All right, kids! We'll meet you at the top! Just be careful! I'm actually a little more concerned about us. Um, do you know how to weld? That worked so well. We have several hours before the others arrive. What say we get comfy? Now we have electricity. This propane tank will supply us with heat. And this doorknob, properly turned... will allow us access to the cabin. No going through the window for us. Bart: Is there maple syrup in this one? There isn't any food in any of these trees. Please, Bart, we've gotta hurry. I can't be the last one to reach the cabin. Hey, I'm not gonna get fired. Is there any gold in this mountain? It doesn't matter! I'll check. Mr. Smithers! Mr Smithers! I found another hurt shrew. I think this one has a twisted ankle. [Sighs] Twisted- Aren't there any healthy animals in this forest? Well, I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early... Homie, old boy. More champagne? [Chuckles] You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny. Oh, yes. But I'd trade it all for a little more. Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs. Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasant... who doesn't enjoy a good sit? Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this? Yes, yes, that's it. Oh, I could go for one of those right now. Ah! The only hard part is getting up. [Chuckling] Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip. Why, you'd have to get up! Oh? [Grunting] Sir, I am in your debt. Use it wisely, my friend. [Clink Echoing] [Rumbling] [Both Gasping] Hey, did you hear something? No. Hmm. Did I? I don't know! Hope that wasn't an avalanche. Be a chum and take a look-see. You got it, buddy. Oh. Isn't there any way out of here? I don't see one. Unless- No. There's no way out. There must be some way to contact the outside world. Ah! The telegraph! S.0.S. [Beeping] Avalanche. Send help. [Beeping] According to the map, the cabin should be right here. [Straining] Hey, maybe there is no cabin. Maybe it's one of them, uh, metaphorical things. Oh, yeah, yeah. Like, maybe the cabin is the place inside each of us... created by our goodwill and teamwork. Oh! Nah. They said there'd be sandwiches. Simpson, I have a confession. I'm not quite the tunnel-digger I made myself out to be. You can supervise me. All right, good. Let's dig. That's right. Dig some more. Oh, we make quite a duo. Burns and Associate. No, no! What am I thinking? Burns and Teammate. [Grunting] We made it, old friend! We sure did. Huzzah! Whoo-hoo! [Both Yelling] D'oh! What happened? I think when we yelled, we caused another avalanche. We should be careful... not to speak... unless it's... absolutely... positively necessary. Shh. You're causing... more avalanches. I... think... they've... stopped. Let's go. Oh! Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson. So what? Sew buttons! There's not another place for miles. This must be the cabin Burns was talkin' about. Well, we made it here first, all thanks to teamwork. Yeah, my teamwork. We must be covered by a thousand feet of snow. It could be days before they find us. Mmm. No books, no radio, no board games. [Gasps] A Bazooka Joe comic. [Groans] I heard that one 75 years ago. We could build snowmen. No, I have a better idea. We could build real men out of snow. Oh. Okay. [All Shivering] Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! That moose is on fire! Fine. Good. I don't care anymore. I'm the last one here. You kids cost me my job. You ain't last, Mr. Smithers. [Sighs] Thank goodness. Yeah, Burnsie and Homer never made it. Mr. Burns is still out there? What about our dad? Ah! 206 bones... 50 miles of small intestine, full, pouting lips. Why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god! Well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours. l- I think we should dress the snowmen. Agreed. Look at them, smug and secure in their finery... mocking us. They're just snowmen, Mr. Burns. Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch- to watch for a moment of weakness. And then, baf, comes the knock on the head, and we're down! What do we do? Oh, wouldn't you like to know? Hey, what is going on here? Who are you people? This is a lookout post. Where is Ranger McFadden? Well, I was just happy to see so many nice people. Quiet, you drunk. Where's Ranger McFadden? Right here, sir, right behind the drunk. Wait a minute. If this is a ranger station, we must be in the wrong place. The only other cabin is right over... there. Huh. [Whistles] Look at all these avalanches. You think they could've buried the cabin? Well, I'll tell you one thing. They didn't come here... for the Mountain Music Festival, March 14-18. Mom, Dad and Mr. Burns could be trapped in there! [Gasps] [Thinking] I'm trapped with a madman. Look at him staring into me... filling my mind with paranoid thoughts. [Homer Thinking] Mmm. Look at his eyes. He's trying to hypnotize me! But not in the good Las Vegas way. [Mr. Burns Thinking] I know what he's up to. He's thinking of killing me... then riding my carcass down the mountain to safety. He's truly gone mad if he's thinking that. Well, he can't kill me if I kill him first! I'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery! You and what army? [Gasps] Stand back! I have powers! Uh, political powers! [Gasps] It's showtime! [Grunting] Give me- Let go off that- Oh, God! My head. [Grunting] [Gasps] Homer! Burnsie! [Both Yelling] Okay, search party, before we set out... let's take a moment to humor the children. Kids, your father's gonna be just fine. Okay, everybody, put on your corpse-handling gloves. We've got two frozen bodies buried somewhere in this mountain. Did you hear that, Lise? Dad's gonna be just fine. Look! What's that? [Both Yelling] We'll be dashed to pieces! Oh, Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house. It's them, all right. We're over here, Homie! Oh. Something's wrong with its brakes. Gangway! Marge, kids. [Voices Overlapping] [Clears Throat] Have you people forgotten our little competition? Last one in the cabin is fired. [All Shouting] You're fired, Lenny. Aw, nuts! So, how did we do? [Ticking] It's a new record, sir. Outstanding. Well, perhaps all of this has been worthwhile. Did you all learn about teamwork? [All] Yes. Excellent. In that case, no one will be fired after all. That old goat can't fire me. I'm gonna give him a piece of my- [Yelling] [Thud] - Aw, nuts! Well, Simpson, I must say... once you've been through something like that with a person... you never want to see that person again. You said it, ya weirdo!

Ma, could you get me some milk? Can't you get it yourself? No, that's okay. I'll just go without liquid. [Gagging] Oh, all right, all right. I'll get your milk. Thank you. Does anyone else want anything while I'm up? [Together] No. Marge, get me a beer. [Growls] Uh, Mom? What? Um, there's a hair in my soup- but I'll just eat around it. What kind of hair? Well, it's blue, six feet long- [Both] Eww! It's my hair! [Gasps] Excuse me. Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her- during the commercial. Now let's hear it for a great American- former President Gerald Ford. Thank you, Krusty, for inviting me. Well, all the good presidents turned us down. Oh, well. I'd like to talk about a subject... that is very important to me. [Alarm Buzzing] The Boy Scouts of America have molded men... for over 100 years, and- What are you- Oh! Uh, how's your wife Nancy?

I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell- Just like my hair. [Sobbing] Mrs. Simpson, there's no physical reason... why your hair should be falling out. This thing has me buffaloed. [Laughs] Phone call, Mrs. Simpson- Lines one and two. Bart: Ma, I need a glass of milk. Lisa: Me too. [Groans] I think the problem may be stress. I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help. Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it. Well, I was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out. A nanny? But how am I supposed to pay for that? We'll find a way. Mom has made so many sacrifices for us- It's time we gave up something for her. I'll stop buying Malibu Stacy clothing. And I'll take up smoking, and give that up. Good for you, Son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar. But he didn't do anything. Didn't he, Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute. He didn't. Homie, please. I never ask for much, but this is something I really need. All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny. And to pay for it I'll give up the Civil War re-creation society I love so much. Well, Homer's out. We gotta find a new General Ambrose Burnside. And I'm not too crazy about our Stonewall Jackson. The South shall come again. [Doorbell Rings] Hello. I'm Mrs. Pennyfeather. I understand you're looking for a nanny. Pleased to meet you. Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire.

But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out? Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too... but God knows we don't need to see you every day. An occasional hug is all I ask. Mom! You can hug me when I'm asleep. I do. [Screams] [Krusty Groaning] Hey, Krusty, you look great. You get your teeth bleached? Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment- Hey, shut up! You're here 'cause your Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are stinking up my ratings! Look at this breakdown of yesterday's show. [Muttering] Kaboom! What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter? See, that's what I thought at first, but then- Hey, shut up! That crater is where your lousy cartoon crash-landed! It's ratings poison! But Itchy and Scratchy is critically acclaimed. Acclaimed? [Spits] I oughta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon... where the robots turn into blingwads! But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger. So I'll give you one more chance. Get out! Don't come back till you fix Itchy and Scratchy. Woman: Okay, Mel, you can go in now. Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock 'N' Roll Museum. And- I'll come back later. I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department. Oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later? Mmm, okay. Just be careful. Would you kids like to come with me? Sounds good to me. Let's go. Okay. I guess so. All right, thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today we're gonna show you some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons. [All Cheering] Cool! We want you to tell us what you think. And be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you.

Okay, how many of you kids would like Itchy and Scratchy... to deal with real-life problems like the ones you face every day? [All Shouting] Great idea! Yeah, that's it! And who would like to see them do just the opposite- getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?

You kids don't know what you want. That's why you're still kids- 'cause you're stupid! Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show! [Crying] [Buzzing] Mommy! Um, excuse me, sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy and Scratchy Show. It's as good as ever. But after so many years... the characters just can't have the same impact they once had.

Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy and Scratchy. I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show. It is so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it. What we need is... a new character! One that today's kids can relate to! Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here... but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad. Hey, this ain't art! It's business! What do ya got in mind? Sexy broad? Gangster octopus? No. No. The animal chain of command goes... mouse, cat, dog. D-O-G. Uh, a dog? Isn't that a tad predictable? In your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell. You mean Cerberus? We at the network want a dog with attitude. He's edgy. He's in your face. You've heard the expression "let's get busy." Well, this is a dog who gets "biz-zay." Consistently and thoroughly. So he's proactive, huh? Oh, God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm. Excuse me, but "proactive" and "paradigm"- aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I? Oh, yes. The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog. I don't know. Something along the lines of, say, Poochie. Only more proactive. Yeah! [Door Slams] So, Poochie okay with everybody? Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's good. No, no, no. He was supposed to have attitude! Um, wh-wh-what do you mean exactly? Oh, you know, attitude! Attitude! Uh, sunglasses! Can we put him in more of a hip-hop context? Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer. Give me a nice schmear of surfer. I feel we should "rastafy" him by 10% or so. Hmm. I think he needs a little more attitude. Oh, yeah, bingo! There it is right there! Yeah, that works. That's it. I love it. Hey, Lise, look. They're adding a new character to Itchy and Scratchy. Poochie the Dog? Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings. Yo, yo. How's it hangin', everybody? Morning, Roy. Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie. You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice. I do not! Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder? I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick. Well, here. Say something. Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying howdy... to all the girls out there in radio land. [Rewinding] Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying- [Screams] I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice. That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom. Whoa! A talking dog. [Laughs] What were you guys smokin' when you came up with that? We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please? Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog. You're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect! Next to you, perfection is crap! Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such cartoons as... Christmas Ape and Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp. You're even better than this guy. Take a hike, you bum. [Groans] [Clears Throat] Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog. Now, that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous... and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next. Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly! That's it! That's the Poochie attitude! Do that again. Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did. Then you don't get the job. Next. Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo! I don't get to be a cartoon dog! That's it! You've got the job! Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh, thank you. Okay, Homer, let's get a level check on your voice. She smells sheet smells by the sheet "shtore." Wait. Wait. Let me try it again. Relax, Homer. You'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy. You? But you're a lady. [Itchy's Voice] She's a lady all right. [Scratchy's Voice] A beautiful lady. [Laughing] Hey, that really is you! How'd you get to be so good? Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Roadrunner. "Meep." You mean "meep-meep"? No. They only paid me to say it once. Then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards. You folks ready to begin? Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live? No, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live. It's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists. Hi. Question for Miss Bellamy. In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone... he strikes the same rib twice in succession... yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we- to believe that this is some sort of a- [Chuckles] a magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder. Uh, well, uh- I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose shirt says "genius at work"... spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show? I withdraw my question. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy and Scratchy CD-ROM... is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key? What the hell are you talking about? You're a lifesaver, Homer. I can't deal with these hard-core fans. [Clears Throat] Your attention, please. Uh, in episode- Uh, your attention, please! Mr. Simpson will now be autographing 8-by-10 glossies of Poochie. One per customer. Please form a line. There will be no cutting. I'm talking to you, Mr. Cutter. Pardon me. Look out. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hot soup. Hi. Kindly make one out to me... and three out to my friend of the same name. Marge: I'm so glad you couldjoin us for Homer's big premiere. [Chattering] Poochie's based on me. Is this seat taken, little girl? I'm not a girl! Are you blind? Yes. I am stoked, Mr. S. Shh. Everybody, it's coming on! Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a television event... so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared heritage. 1969- man walks on the moon. 1971 - man walks on the moon... again. Then for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of comedy. Poochie! [Children Cheering] ♪ [Singing] Ah. Look, Scratchy! It's our new friend, Poochie! What's that name again? I forgot. ♪ [Rapping] Ooh, Poochie is one outrageous dude. He's totally in my face. ♪ [Electric Guitar] Wiggity, wiggity. Word up. Rock on, party. When are they gonna get to the fireworks factory? [Whining] Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on? Midge, help me out here. Quiet! You're missing the jokes. ♪ [Rock] Catch you on the flip side, "dudemeisters." Not! Hey, kids, always recycle... to the extreme! Busted! [Tires Screeching] Ah, that stunk! Well, what did everybody think? [All Muttering] Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of lmpy and Chimpy I've ever seen. Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer. You, uh, got a beautiful home here. [Tires Screeching] [Grunts] So, it was pretty okay, huh? Mom, can we go to bed without dinner? Yes, we can. [Door Slamming] Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I? [Thinking] Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now, look sad and say "d'oh." D'oh. I'm the worst Poochie ever. No, it's not your fault, Dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords. Don't have a cow, Lise. Bart's right. Let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it. Last night's Itchy and Scratchy was, without a doubt... the worst episode ever! Rest assured that I was on the lnternet within minutes... registering my disgust throughout the world. Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain? As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me. What? They've given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them. Worst episode ever. It looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable Itchy and Scratchy program. For years, TV critics such as yours truly, Kent Brockman... have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday our prayers were finally answered... when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut. Far be it from me to gloat in another's downfall... but I have a feeling no children are gonna be crying... when this puppy is put to sleep. [Laughing] [Cries] What the hell happened? Well, I'd attribute the product failure... to fundamental shifts in our key demographic... coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie. [Cries] Oh, you gotta stop this thing! [Crying] Please! I'm gettin' egged on the street! Do somethin'! Do somethin'! [Crying Continues] [Knocking] Uh, hi, Mr. Meyers. I've been doing some thinking, and I got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here. Uh, one: Poochie needs to be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine. Two: Whenever Poochie's not on screen... all the other characters should be asking, "Where's Poochie?" Three- Great. Great. Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out. [Chattering] Man: Okay, so, anyway- Hmm. [Chattering Continues] Listen, guys, we've gotta do something about Poochie. Krusty: There's only one thing we can do. Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off. Really? Oh, how terrible. Yes, terrible. It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a, um, yak in heat! You're right, Marge. It's not my fault. I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy. Right on, Mr. S. Put a sock in it, Roy. Okay, so here's where Itchy lunges at Poochie... with a rusty chain saw. Cue sound effects. [Chain Saw Sound] Rustier! [Rustier Sound] [Itchy's Voice] Are you prepared to die, Poochie? No, I am not. Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut. Just stick to the script as written, Homer. You're supposed to say, " Please cut off my head. I don't deserve to live." Never! [All Gasping, Muttering] You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries. But first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands. Forget it, Homer! We can do this show without you if we have to. But not without me. Oh, geez! Let him try the new lines. All right. All right. We'll try them. Action. [Itchy's Voice] Hi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say. Do you? Yes, I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away... and I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted... I know we can make 'em laugh... and cry till we grow old together. And... cut. Now, kids, I know you loved the old Poochie... but the new one's gonna be better than 10 Super Bowls! I don't wanna oversell it. Judge for yourself. [Screams] Well, look who's here. Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you? Yes, I certainly do. [Man's Voice] I have to go now. My planet needs me. ♪ [Organ] Wow! Poochie came from another planet? Uh, I guess. Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me! Poochie's dead! [Guffawing] [Cheering] Well, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die... they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit... that Poochie will never, ever, ever return! This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes. [Children Cheering] Oh, yeah! [TV Switches Off] Tough break, Dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years. Good news, everybody. I'm movin' into my own apartment with two sexy ladies. Oh, then I guess this is good-bye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years. [Clicks Tongue] Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn. ♪ [Instrumental] Oh! [Screaming] [Laughs] It's back to the basics- classic Itchy and Scratchy. We should thank our lucky stars they're still putting on... a program of this caliber after so many years. What else is on?

#08x16 - Brother From Another Series^Man: Live from Springfield Penitentiary's fabulous big open area in cell block "D"... it's the Krusty the Clown Prison Special. ♪ [Country, Upbeat] [Prisoners Cheering] ♪ [Singing] [All Grumbling] Hey, hey, I kid. I kid 'cause I love. I tell ya, the best folk in the world are prison folk! Man, those cons love Krusty. Inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a 10-year-old boy. And vice versa. Just remember, Bart. Convicts aren't cool. They're bad people. Yeah, maybe so, but they get the job done. Hey! Now I know where my tax dollars are going. ♪ [Rimshot] [Chuckles] Huh? Hey, hey! It's my old TV sidekick, Sideshow Bob! Why, I haven't seen you in years! What have you been doing with yourself, Bob? Well, Krusty, as you may remember, after I tried to frame you for armed robbery... I tried to murder Selma Bouvier. Let's see. I rigged the mayoral elections... I tried to blow up Springfield with a nuclear device, and I tried to kill you. Oh, yeah, yeah. And whenever I could find a spare moment, I've tried to murder... Bart Simpson. [Screaming] [Door Slamming] He said "tried"! [Groans] Someone should really go up there and talk to him. [Groans] [Sighs] Homer! Ohh, all those stairs. Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey. Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes. We're very proud of you, by the way. And, sure, he's probably so insane with rage... that he'd butcher you horribly if he could. But he's safely locked away. In a medium-security prison. For life! Unless he gets out somehow. Which is impossible! Or so you think. Except he's done it so many times before. Thanks for trying, guys. But Sideshow Bob wants me dead. And Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine. ♪ [Organ] ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Organ Stops] Well, that was lovely, Robert. You other cons could benefit from his shining example. [All Grumbling] Really, Reverend, your praise is gonna get me beaten up. I'm sorry, Bob, but your transformation is truly inspiring. Yes, I'm a good, good man. You know, it's hard to believe this model prisoner... could be the same monstrous fiend who once ran for mayor. It's a pleasure to have recommended you for the work-release program. Me? I'm touched. I really am. But you'll never find anyone willing to hire a five-time loser like me. I already have. Cecil? Is it really you? Hello, Brother. I'm happy to see you. But it's been 10 years. We haven't spoken since the... unpleasantness. You mean Arthur Fiedler's wake? No, no, no. I mean our falling out. Oh, that! That's ancient history. Let's make a fresh start. Come work for me. But this is wonderful! You do know I used to have a- [Clears Throat] problem with trying to kill people? Goodness, I had no idea. For, you see, I have been on Mars for the last decade... in a cave with my eyes shut and my fingers in my ears. Touché, Cecil. I'm aware of your felonious past but you are still my brother. And blood is thicker than bread and water. You don't have to worry about me, Brother. I'm all murdered out. Praise the Lord! [Crowd Shouting] Get back in there! Get back in there! How can you even think of releasing Sideshow Bob? He's just faking it to get out of jail! He's a maniac! Bob is no maniac. He explained his reasons for trying to kill us all. And I assure you, they were perfectly sane. Oh, you gotta be kidding! My friends, please! I make no secret of my past. But isn't our system of justice based on the idea that a man can change? Uh, have the boys check into that. I know I don't deserve another chance. But this is America. And as an American, aren't I entitled to one? Probably! Can't you find it in your hearts just to let me live and work in peace? [Crowd Cheering] [Whimpers] Hi! Don't you see what you've done? Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed. He's pure evil! Oh, if only you knew what he was thinking! [Thinking] I hope they still make that shampoo I like. Now, make yourself at home. Perhaps a glass of Bordeaux? I have the '82 Château Latour and a rather indifferent Rauzan-Ségla. I've been in prison, Cecil. I'll be happy just as long as it doesn't taste like orange drink fermented under a radiator. That would be the Latour then. And God bless Mom and Dad and Lisa and Maggie. And please, God, kill Sideshow Bob. Bart, no! It's him or me, O Lord! [Grunts] You can't ask God to kill someone! Yeah! You do your own dirty work. Well, I suppose I should ask you what you do if I'm to be working with you. For me, Bob. For me. I am Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. Hydrological and hydrodynamical. Talk about running the gamut. Snigger all you like, Bob. Thank you. I believe I shall. But you'll find one gets more respect as a humble civil servant... than as a homicidal maniac or a clown's sidekick. Aha! I knew it! You're still angry that Krusty picked me instead of you. I can't imagine what you mean. Oh, come now! You wanted to be Krusty's sidekick since you were five! What about the buffoon lessons? The four years at clown college? I'll thank you not to refer to Princeton that way. The point is you obviously still blame me for what happened at your audition. [Whimpers] Thanks for driving me, big brother. These giant clown mitts are extremely hilarious, but do make it difficult to shift gears. That's the title of Erma Bombeck's latest, isn't it? Number 73. You're next. Make with the laugh-laugh. ♪ [Drumroll] [Clears Throat] Hey, children! Meet me, Sideshow Cecil! [Krusty Imitating Buzzer] Next! Uh, I have prepared a pie-in-the-face take. [Groans] All right. Knock yourself out, kid. Hal! Ooh. Ha-ha! Free comedy tip, slick. The pie gag's only funny when the sap's got dignity! Like that guy. Hey, Hal! Pie job for Lord Autumnbottom there! Oh, dear. That guy's a genius! He's gonna change the way we think about getting hit by pies! Chumley, you're hired. When that pie hit your face, I saw my dreams explode in a burst of cream and crust. But I suppose I should thank you. After all, it led me to my true calling. Cecil, no civilization in history has ever considered... chief hydrological engineer a calling. [Clearing Throat] Yes, yes. The Cappadocians. Fine. There it is. The future site of the Springfield hydroelectric dam. Just the thought of that raw, surging power makes me wonder why the hell I should care. Because you'll be supervising the construction crew. Oh, great. Whenever a woman passes by... I suppose it will be my job to lead the hooting. Oh, yeah! Shake it, madam. Capital knockers. Come on, Bob. This is your chance to show the people of Springfield... you can hold down an honest job. He's planning something evil, I know it. It must have something to do with the town's water supply. Maybe he's gonna pee in the river. Mmm, nah. That's not his style. Who is that? Why, it's Bart Simpson! Hello, Bart! He's just shy because I've tried to kill him so many times. Ah. I really must thank you for this moment of tranquillity, Edna. You know, I haven't been on a date in six years. Oh, the pleasure's mine, Bob. It's so exciting to be dating a killer. To be fair, I never successfully killed anyone. Oh. I see. I did once try to kill the world's greatest lover. But then I realized there are laws against suicide. [Laughing] You get my drift. Oh, you. Mrs. Krabappel, no! That's Sideshow Bob! Well, that's the last time I announce my dinner plans in class. That was Edna Krabappel. You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel. I hope you're happy. I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting. He says that, but I bet he gives up pretty quickly. Hello, Brother. All's well I trust? It most certainly is not! The workmen you've given me... don't know their asses from the hole in the ground they accidentally blew yesterday. Come now. You speak as if they were a gaggle of slack-jawed yokels. Mr. Terwilliger, come quick! There's trouble down to the cement mixer, sir! See, Cousin Merl and me was playing fetch with Geech. That's our old smellhound and- Geech gone to heaven, Mr. Terwilliger. Oh, Cousin Merl, really! Temper, temper. You know Cousin Merl ain't been quite right lately. I'm telling you, Cecil, I can't take much more of this! Rustic workmen who have turned the Sanijohn into a smokehouse. Coveralls that don't quite cover all. And a psychotic little boy who will not stop hounding me! This little boy right here! Sometimes I wish this dam would burst... and bury this cursed town. Hey! You said we were going to Dairy Queen. I lied. Now help me rummage through Bob's trash for clues. Then I promise we'll go to the waterslide. Okay. [Screaming] You again! Well, that's it. I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago. [Knocking] Madam, your children are no more... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers. Lisa too? Especially Lisa! But especially Bart! If he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, I can't be held responsible for my actions. Well, I hope Bob fed you 'cause I ate your dinners. I know it's hard to accept, Bart, but face it. Sideshow Bob has changed. No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be. Bob's trailer at the construction site? That's even better. Let's go there. What were you thinking? The haunted mine. Blueprints, concrete invoices, construction schedules. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob was building a dam. Oh, yeah? Then explain this! [Gasps] Bart, there must be millions of dollars there. What is Sideshow Bob doing with- [Doorknob Rattling] [Growls] [Grunting] [Both Screaming] Who left the lights on? Who's in here? Cletus? Cousin Merl? Big Hungry Joe? Bart: I think he may have spotted us. Lisa: Run! You two. Be careful! There's hydroelectricity in there! Bart: Oops. Will you children stop tormenting me! I've done nothing wrong. Give it up, Bob. We found the money. Where did that come from? I've never seen that money before in my life. Then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it! I told you, I'm not a criminal anymore. You want to know what I've been up to? Here's a clue for you, Jack! One hundred thousand tons of reinforced concrete. Oh, my God! It's completely hollow! What happened to all the concrete? You cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself. That's what happened. Get him, Lise! [Shouting] But I wasn't in charge of the money. Cecil was. Now, let's stop bickering and get out of here. This dam could collapse at any minute! [Cecil] One minute past sunrise, to be precise. Cecil? Once I blow up the dam... there'll be no evidence of missing concrete, and I walk away with 15 million. But everyone will know you did this! Perhaps. Or perhaps they'll blame the master criminal. You know, the one who's been working at the dam and has a grudge against Springfield. I know Cousin Merl has had his troubles with the revenuers, but he's hardly a master- Oh. You're referring to me. Yes, I'm framing you. And I'm doing a really excellent job too. Wait a minute. This is all because I got to be Krusty's sidekick instead of you, isn't it? Off the record, yes. But officially, I did it for the money! Speaking of which, hand it over. Ta. I forgot to mention, I'm planning to blow up the dam with you inside. Well, obviously. [Door Locking] Oh, it's hopeless. Utterly, utterly hopeless. Oh, I see. When it's one of my schemes, you can't foil it fast enough. But when Cecil tries to kill you... "It's hopeless. Utterly, utterly hopeless." Well, if you kids aren't going to foil him, I'll have to do it myself. Come on! Quickly now! Bart, for once I'm not trying to kill you. I know it's awkward and I don't like it any more than you do. But you've got to trust me. Ah, what the hell. [All lnhale Deeply] [All Screaming] [Coughing] [Gagging] [Coughing] Let's go again! Let's go again! No! Come on, children! Let's go thwart my brother! ♪ [Cecil Singing Joyfully] ♪ [Singing Stops] Um, do you know what you're doing? Lisa, you don't spend 10 years as a homicidal maniac... without learning a few things about dynamite. Plunger, check. Hard hat, check. Fifteen million dollars and a gun, checkmate. Good-bye, Bob! No-o-o! Guess who! Maris? [Groaning] O-O-Oh... shoot! [Bart, Cecil Grunting] Bob, look! At last I'm going to do what Bob never could- kill Bart Simpson! By throwing me off a dam? Isn't that a little crude for a genius like you? Ooh, I suppose it is. Huh. If anyone asks, I'll lie. [Screaming] [Gasps] Bart! Bart! [Gasps] [Both Screaming] Cecil. And now to kill you. There may be a slight ringing in your ears. Fortunately, you'll be nowhere near them. I guess this is it. Thanks, anyway. You know, I could snip the wires. We'd fall to our deaths, but we'd save the entire town. Bart, how would you like to do something incredibly noble? Do we have to? Yes. [Both Screaming] [Screaming Stops, Both lnhale] [Screaming Resumes] [Bob Whimpers] You-You saved my life, Bart. Yeah. I guess this means you can't ever try to kill me again, huh? Oh, I don't know about that. [Whimpers] Joking. Joking. [Sirens Wailing] You've brought shame to this family, Cecil. Oh, I don't relish having to write the Christmas letter this year. Nor I to read it. You know, Bob, all this time I thought you were a bungler. But destroying this city is far tougher than I thought. Here's your man, Chief. Cecil? I think not. This looks like the work of crazy old Sideshow Bob. No, Chief, Bob's innocent. It's the truth. The truth, huh? That sounds like the testimony of crazy old Lisa Simpson. But Cecil just voluntarily confessed, Chief. That's some good work, Lou. You'll make sergeant for this. Uh, I already am sergeant, Chief. Perhaps you are. But I say Bob goes back to jail. But surely- I mean, I caught Cecil! Maybe so. But Lou here says you were resisting arrest. No, I didn't, Chief. Quiet, Lou... or I will bust you down to sergeant so fast it'll make your head spin. [Chuckles] Funny, isn't it, Lise? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction. Marge, I'm going to look for the kids! [Gasps] [Rumbling] I think I wet my bed. But you can't do this! I saved the children's lives! I'm a hero! Tell them they'll live to regret this. You'll live to regret this! Oh, thanks a lot. Now I look crazy. There they go, two criminal geniuses locked away together. Who knows what diabolical schemes they might concoct? [Both Grunting] I'm older! I get the top bunk! Oh, poppycock! I called it at the arraignment! Get back! So, when do they bring us the menus?
#08x17 - My Sister, My Sitter^Tonight on Eye on Springfield... opening day at the world's first two-story outhouse. Man: Oh, God! Stop! A comedy nurse who's laughing all the way to the blood bank. Okay. How many of you are here for shoulder surgery, huh? [All Groaning] Got ya! But first- move over, Baltimore. Springfield has stolen your idea. I'm walking on the waterfront, once the center of a thriving squid-gutting industry... now abandoned by all but a few longshoremen and allied tradespeople. But the decades of rot will end... with the opening of the South Street Squidport... an upscale shopping promenade... with authentic maritime theming. And to kick it all off in style... area merchants will host a black-tie gala Saturday night. Ooh, that sounds fabulous, Homer! Stores throw the best parties. You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend. You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV. The important thing is I didn't imagine it. I can't get enough of The Babysitter Twins. They arrested the counterfeiters, rescued the president... and made four dollars! I love everything about the world of babysitting- the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure. And full refrigerator privileges! That's a trust, Janie, a sacred trust. Geez! Lighten up, Lisa. ♪ [Organ] [Reverend Lovejoy] That concludes our service. All right. I have two announcements. Friday you will have the chance to "party down" in the church basement... to the Jesus-rock stylings ofTestament. That's Friday, 6:00 p.m. sharp. [Snorts] All the best bands are affiliated with Satan. Also, anyone in need of a reliable and affordable babysitter... should call Lisa Simpson. Mention the topic of today's sermon to get a dollar off. [Man Coughing] [Clears Throat] The topic was love. Why hasn't anyone called? Maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. Parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. That's why they hire teenagers. But- But I'm very mature for my age. People often mistake me for nine. [Doorbell Rings] Homer, I've got a Fozzie of a bear of a problem. Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon... the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god... because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort. Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses. Well, anyhoo-dilly-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking... but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get them out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight? Oh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders... but, uh, Marge was taken prisoner... in the... Holy Land, and- I'll do it! I'll babysit! Oh, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately. But I'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door. Well, what do you say, Homer? Can Lisa babysit for my kids? Please, please, please! Uh, I'll have to ask her. Where are the dice? Daddy says dice are wicked. We just move one space at a time. It's less fun that way. [Both] Moth! Moth! Moth! Moth! Moth! Moth! Don't worry. A moth is no more harmful than a ladybug. A ladybug? [Screaming] [Groans] They're gonna get eaten alive in middle school. And thank you for sending Lisa to protect us from the bug you sent. And please make Lisa tell us a bedtime story... about robots named Rod and Todd. Amen. Once there was a robot named Todd- Did he have a brother? Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod, who was two space years older than him. I don't like this story! [Ned] Oh, imagine that! Sleeping quietly after a bug attack. And Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder. I'm gonna recommend you to everybody! So long, Lisa! If anything goes wrong, just dial 911 - unless it's an emergency. Lisa: Okay, Chief! Enjoy Bob Saget! [Chuckles] It's Bob Seger. Aw, crap! Now, put your left leg into the left side of the pants, and you're done. I dress myself. Hey, Dad. How come you're wearing a tuxedo? Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow. Why are you wearing it now? It's like a rent-a-car, Son. You get all the mileage you can... then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot. [Car Door Opens, Closes] Lisa: Thanks for the ride! Well, you did a first-rate job of babysitting. I've never seen such a responsible young lady. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Your trust means so much to me. I only wish my Volvo mechanic were as reliable. [Laughing] Good night, Lisa. You made all that money for sitting around and watching TV and eating food? There's a lot more to it than that, Bart. I don't just babysit. I sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour- two dollars after 9:00. Man, if I was making that kind of money, I'd be out of here so fast! [Giggles] Lisa: You look so glamorous, Mom! [Sniffs] Oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers. Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss. Can you see the pie stains? It'll be dark. So, when's Grampa getting here to babysit? Um, Grampa's not coming. Oh, not Patty and Selma! Actually, Bart, Lisa's going to be in charge tonight. What? I know she's young, but Lisa has proven herself mature and dependable. Dad, help me out. Take it like a man, boy, and do everything your little sister says. This is an outrage! I am two years and 38 days older than she is! This is the greatest injustice in the history of the world! Well, we have to run. I'm sure you kids will work things out. Good night. [Kissing] But- uh- uh- Make sure he brushes his teeth, Lisa. Bart, I know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter... but I'm not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun. You're dead. You should wash up for dinner. To make it fun, you can use the Mr. Bubble. It'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath. You are so dead. Oh, I love this pedestrian mall. There's practically no traffic. [Horn Honking] [Gasping] I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us. Stop, you idiots! All right. All right. Geez! Okay, honey. Remember where we're parked. [All Grumbling] May I have some more lima beans, please? Certainly. More than that. Certainly. More. More. More. Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have. I didn't say I was gonna eat them. I just wanted to look at them because they're so gross. What's for dessert? [Sighs] Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby. Oh, I'm a baby, huh? Well, then I'll act like a baby. Ga-ga! Goo-goo! Even babies know how to open and close their mouths. You need a bib. [Gags] Oh, baby hate bib. [Fake Crying] Oh, look, Bart. Now you got Maggie all upset. Relax. I'll give her some ice cream. [Coos, Sighs] Bart, that's coffee ice cream. It has caffeine in it! Well, I guess that'll make things more interesting for you now, won't it? [Gasps] Ooh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like. You've never been? I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us yuppies, huh, Homie? Nah. I'm really more of a slacker. Ooh! Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop! Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity. [Laughing] Yes, it's true. The entire menu was personally approved by my secretary. Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building. Help me. Wow! Even Moe's moved to fancy new digs. Hey, this isn't faux dive! [Scoffs] This is a dive. You're a long way from home, yuppie boy. I'll start a tab. Maggie, if you come down... I'll give you some more coffee. Lots more coffee! Are you getting ready for bed, Bart? I am! That's right. I want the 25-foot ltalian party sub. And don't skimp on the vinegar. It's time Lisa learned what babysitting Bart Simpson is all about. [Beeping] Yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible. Come on, Maggie. Good Maggie. The talcum powder's not to play with. [Coughing] Oh! Okay, Bart. Now it's really time for you to go to bed. [Grunts] Why do you have to make this so hard? I'm using nonviolent resistance. Ugh! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi! Who? [Doorbell Rings] I'll answer it. You go to bed. Good evening there, miss. Here's your giant sub, swimming in vinegar, just the way you like it. It's gonna be $225, plus tip. What? I didn't order any giant sub. [Doorbell Rings] Hey, hey! Are you ready to get rowdy? Excuse me? Somebody hired me for an emergency bachelor party. Well, there's been a mistake. Well, I'm not leaving till I get paid. I get 500 just for "Hey, hey!" [Siren Blares] Who called for an emergency "sisterectomy"? [Angry Grunt] [Shutter Clicks] [Doorbell Rings] We got a report that a Lisa Simpson spotted a U.F.O. I didn't see any U.F. O! That's right, miss. You didn't. I'm here to pick up the ambassador from Ghana. Well, he's not here! Nobody's here! And none of you should be here! You've all been tricked! [All Gasping] Why would the ambassador do such a thing? Krusty: This is ridiculous. [Grumbling] [Growls] Bart, you are gonna be in so much trouble when Mom and Dad get home. Now, go to bed! You're the boss. [Groaning] I thought I told you to go to bed. Yeah, right. "Bread." You said, "Go to bread." I said, "Go to bed." Yeah. "Go to bread." B-E-D! Bed! Oh! "Bed"! Oh. Well, anything you say, Sis. [Growls] You didn't say which bed! Go to your bed! Make me! I'll make you! If you want me, you gotta catch me! [Grunts] Almost. [Snarls] Oh, so close. Bart! [Grunting] Son of a- [Grunting] Oh, my God! Okay, we'll call it even if I can just have some of that big sandwich. Oh. [Nervous Chuckle] I'll come back. [Gasps] Bart, are you okay? Yeah, I think so. It's just a bump on my head. [Gasps] Eww! Your arm! It's got extra corners! [Gasps] Oh, cool! It must be dislocated or something. We have to get you to the emergency room! And get this fixed? What's the rush? Don't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were? Stop it! Stand still! Maybe I can pop it back in. Oh, no. I'm going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home. And you'll never babysit again! [Door Slams] [Groans] You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together- [Gasping] Did you see that, Marge? Oh, my God! You walked into the fountain! Get out of the fountain! [Gasping] Just stand still, and I'll get someone! [Whimpering] [All Laughing] Don't laugh at me. I was once like you. Bart, you need first aid! Let me in! I'm afraid you'll hurt me again. Bart, if you come out, I'll let you eat raw cookie dough. I'll let you ride the lawn mower through the house! Come on! Open the door! [Banging] What are you doing now? I'm banging my head. I'm gonna make the lump even bigger. [Sinister Laughing] No! As your babysitter, I order you to stop hitting your head on the wall! [Banging Continues, Thudding] Bart? Did you stop because I said to? If so, thank you. Bart? [Whimpering] [Gasps] [Gasps] [Beeping] Woman: 911. Hello. This is Lisa Simpson and- Simpson? Look, we've already been out there tonight for a "sisterectomy"... a case of severe butt rot and a leprechaun bite. How dumb do you think we are? [Dial Tone Humming] [Groans] Wait! Dr. Hibbert! Hmm. Dislocated shoulder, bump on the noggin. My diagnosis? Bad babysitting! Well, near as we can tell, the boy was studying quietly... when the girl, drunk on her own sense of power... beat him silly with a block of frozen lima beans. It's true! Young lady, you will never babysit again! I am so disappointed. [Echoing] pointed, -pointed. Oh! Well, I guess I don't have a choice. "Complete confidentiality"? Oh? Well, I'm sure he's as good as Dr. Hibbert. It says so right in his ad. What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jell-O shooters. [Slurping] Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call. Oh, come on, Marge. Relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one. [Grunts] Hold on, Bart. Everything's gonna be just fine. I'm gonna get you to a doctor. He will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow, we'll all be a happy family. Happy, happy, happy family! [Quiet Cooing] Maggie! Please, Maggie. Please go to sleep. Yo, um, I must've, like, fallen on a bullet... and it, like, drove itself into my gut. Hey, don't worry. You don't have to make up stories here. Save that for court. Um, excuse me, Mr. Smithers. Bart may be seriously hurt. Could we possibly go ahead of you? Um, no. I really would rather get this taken care of. Excuse me, little lady. The wheelbarrow line's over there. [Monkey Hooting] Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. [Groans] [Siren Blares] Hold it right there. Well, if it isn't Springfield's finest little babysitter, Lisa Simpson! Hi! How are you? Um, I'm fine. Now, Lisa, when you're walking down the side of the road... you always want to be sure to go with traffic, okay? Well, is that with traffic or against traffic? It's with traffic. With traffic. Anyway, good night. [Sighs] Uh, hold on a minute. Let me have a look at that wheelbarrow, please. Okay. Just as I thought! It's a Yard King! That is a quality barrow. Well, I gotta run. [Car Door Closes, Engine Starts] [Tires Screech] Oh, God! Where's Bart? [Gasps, Loud Groaning] [Whimpering] [Screams, Grunts] Oh, Bart, I'm so sorry. This is all like a bad dream! [Electronic Hissing] Citizens of Springfield... I officially declare this- What the hell is that? Why, it's Lisa Simpson! And look what she's doing! [Crowd Gasping] Man: I don't believe it! She's murdered her brother! And she's trying to dump the body in a harbor! Well, duh! And as a grim finale, she intends to drown that poor caged baby! Oh, what's happening? Where am I? And she's on drugs! Give me the drugs, Lisa. Dad, I'm not on drugs! I was just trying- [Gasps] His arm! Oh, my special little guy! Are you okay? Hmm. Dislocated shoulder, bump on the noggin. My diagnosis? Rather nasty fall caused by bad babysitting. [Crowd Murmuring] Hey, Bart. How's your arm? It's all right. I was hoping they'd give me one of those steel claws, but what are you gonna do? I'm- I'm sorry I was such a jerk last night. Guess I sort of ruined your babysitting business. Yeah, well, that's okay. I can always sell seeds. Do you want some seeds? No, thanks. [Groans] [Rings] Hello. World's worst babysitter speaking. [Dr. Hibbert] Lisa, I'm glad I reached you. Are you available to babysit tonight? Aren't you afraid I might take drugs and injure your children? Yes, that is a concern, but it's so hard to find a sitter... and I've got judo tonight. [Beeps] Um, okay. I'm sorry. Can you hold on, please? Hello? Lisa? Ned Flanders. You available tonight? Didn't you hear I almost killed my brother? You did? Just a minute. [Faint Conversation] What time can you come over?
#08x18 - Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment^You sure look stupid in that green dress, Lise. That's funny. I don't feel stupid. [Chattering] Hey. Everybody's wearing green. Oh, no. Pinch! Happy St. Patrick's Day, loser! Ow! Quit it! It's the wearin' of the green, Bart! Pinch, pinch, pinch! No one's pinching his legs. Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch! Oh! Oh! It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours, and I'm still not drunk yet! Oh, it's never gonna be 9:00. Moe! Moe! Thank God you're here. We'd like to come in and drink, please. We kicked down the back door, but then there was a metal door. Yeah, all right. Listen up. This is the busiest drinking day of the year. Where are the designated drivers? Beat it! I got no room for cheapskates. Top of the mornin' to ye on this gray, drizzly afternoon. Kent O'Brockman live on Main Street where today... everyone is a little bit lrish... except, of course, for the gays and the ltalians. All right, then. Move along. Nothin' to see here. Show's over, folks. Parades just bring out so many emotions in me- [Horn Blowing] joy, excitement, looking. Mom, can I go buy one of those long, plastic horns? Oh, Bart, we've bought those before... and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home. [Sighs] I get bored with them. But that won't happen this time. [Groans] Beep-beep! Comin' through! Hey, Notre Dame, move it or lose it. A-oo-ga! Will the owner of the great big butt please move it out of my face. Man: Climb it, man! All right! Hey, Ma, I'm on TV! Hey, where's that weather chick? Ooh! This is some wicked party, huh? Hey, have you seen Sully? Get away from here! Hey! I need that pencil! Ladies and gentlemen, what you are seeing... is a total disregard for the things St. Patrick's Day stands for. All this drinking, violence, destruction of property- Are these the things we think of when we think of the lrish? [Cheering, Shouting] Bart: Hey, give me some room! Watch the elbow, Seamus! Hey, look, everybody! Free beer! Open your yaps, boyos! [Gulping] Hey, what the- Oh! [Belches] Everybody- Everybody get naked! Come on. Don't be stuck-up. It's going to be great. Well, why not? This party's just getting started! Stop the celebration! That small boy is drunk! [Laughing, Hiccups] [All Gasping] [Voices Overlapping] [Hiccuping Continues] Yea, Bart! Yea! [Chattering] Look at me! I'm the prime minister of lreland! Hey, Homer, ain't that your kid on TV? What are you lookin' at? [Hiccups] "What are you looking at?" The innocent words of a drunken child. Well, I'll tell you what we're looking at, young man. A town gone mad! A town whose very conscience was washed away in a tide of beer and green vomit. I'm going down to Moe's for a couple beers. I'll come with you. No! No more drinking. I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother. Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia? [Groans] [Kent Brockman On TV] But what's the solution? Are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive... the antiquated notion of prohibition? Channel 6 says yes. Prohibition. [Scoffs] They tried that in the movies, and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition. [All Chanting] We want prohibition! We want prohibition! You can't seriously want to ban alcohol. It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive... and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism. [Sobbing] Won't somebody please think of the children? What kind of an example are we setting? [Wiggum] Ladies, please. All our founding fathers, astronauts and World Series heroes... have been either drunk or on cocaine. Uh, uh, uh, wait. Lookee here. [Blows] Seems there's been a prohibition law on the books in Springfield for 200 years. It's just never been enforced. [Voices Overlapping] Get out of here, old clerk guy. There's also a law requiring ducks to wear long pants. Wait a minute! Let me see that! Well, I'll be darned. Long pants. Read the other one, the non-duck one. "And spirituous beverages are hereby prohibited... under penalty of catapult." [Chuckling] Did you see this, Bernice? Eh- Oh, my. [Cheering] No, we're not worried. Our customers buy Duff... for its robust taste, not its alcoholic content. I predict our new alcohol-free Duff Zero... will sell even better than our previous brand. Oh! [Grunts] Well, that's the end of me. ♪ [Whistling] ♪ [Up-tempo Jazz] [Man Narrating] Dateline, Springfield.

I run this town! You're just a bunch of low-income nobodies! Uh, election in November. Election in November. What? Again? This stupid country. [Narrator] With rum-running hoodlums in the catbird seat... Springfield sent for the one man who could clean up the town and shoot the gangsters- Rex Banner. [Goofy Laugh] Whoa! Whoa! Ow! Hey, I was watching that. And I was sittin' there. Rex Banner. I'm running this department now. Wiggum, you're out, suspended indefinitely! Huh? Tuck in that shirt! Get those shoes shined! Take that badge out of your mouth! You're police officers. Well, what are you waiting for, somebody to kiss you good-bye? Well? No, no, no. I guess not. [Narrator] Wasting no time, Rex Banner tore into the bootleggers... like a chippie tearing into a lobster. [Tires Screeching] [Rapid Gunfire] How do you know you don't like bribes if you've never taken one? Here. Say, this is nice. No! No bribes! Okay, you win. From now on, we'll stick to smuggling heroin. See that you do! At first, I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work. Hey, hi. Can I arrest any of you people for anything? No. Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town... and so am I. Now, don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life, and I aim to keep it. Sounds like you have a plan. Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do. Come on, boy. Think of a plan. I'm tryin', Dad!

This better be the best-tastin' beer in the world. You got lucky. You see, boy? The real money's in bootlegging... not in your childish vandalism. Oh. So many wasted nights. What's the matter, Chief? Yeah. You've barely touched your Banana Kaboom. This isn't a very happy birthday for Rex Banner. ♪ [Singing, Indistinct] Hello, fishies! [Belches] [Yells] Listen, rummy!

Ah, it's probably clear. Let's go. [Gasps] Beer! I can explain, Marge. Please let me explain. Oh, why won't you let me explain? You're the one the papers have been talking about- that mysterious Beer Baron who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol. How have you been getting away with this? Well- And I can explain, remember? I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump. And then I bowl them... and some underground pipes take them into Moe's. Homer, that's very clever. Huh? Mom? Well, it is. I've known your father since high school... and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, 200-year-old law. It is silly, Marge.

What kind of pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1:00 a. m? Um- Oh. The best damn pet shop in town! [All] Yeah! All right. But you people remember, baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet... but they grow up. Let's go, boys. Ow! Those gears down there really hurt. You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron... and I'll find you. [Homer in Distance] No, you won't. Yes, I will. Won't. [Narrator] Dateline, Springfield. The elusive Beer Baron... continued to thumb his nose at authorities. Swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say... "Look at me, Rex Banner. I have a new hat. '" Hey, boy, get cracking. Moe upped his order to 20 balls a night. Uh, Dad- Call me Beer Baron. All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business. But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron! Homer, my customers are sobering up... and they ain't gonna stick around for the "ambiance." You gotta get me more beer! Sorry, I'm all out. How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk? Look, find it, buy it, make it- I don't care. Just get me some booze, and fast! Make it, eh? Forty-two bathtubs, please. You know, they're 50 for $3,000 today. I said 42! Now you're making your own alcohol? That's even more illegal than what you were doing before. [Chuckling] Remember, honey... we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots, like all those people in jail. [Rumbling] [All Cheering] [Sniffing] Who wants a bathtub mint julep? Mm-hmm! Are you the Beer Baron? Well, if you're talking about root beer... I plead guilt-diddily-ilty as char-diddily-arged. He's not the Baron. But he sounds drunk. Take him in. Are you the Beer Baron? Yes, but only by night. By day, I'm a mild-mannered reporter for a major metropolitan newspaper. Don't crack wise with me, tubby. Tubby? Oh, yes, tubby. Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'? None of your business. [Rumbling] [Both Screaming] What on earth happened down there? One of the stills- Uh, nothing, Marge. I think it must've been that bean I had for dinner. [Explosions] Kaboom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear. Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again. What, dear? Kablamo! [Explosion] You made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now while you're ahead? [Explosion] Boom. I'll be right back. [Rumbling] [Explosion] [Homer Screaming] [Screaming] Oh, it's hot! Oh! Ooh! I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit. Oh, well, fun's over. But I still have my wonderful money. Stick 'em up! Geez! What happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible. Yeah, never mind how I look. Are you gonna give me the money or not? Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing. Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. Come on! Give me the dough! I can throw this pretty hard! Poor Wiggum. Poor Wiggum. I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh? Um, who? The guy who took your job. Oh, yeah. More than anything in the world! Hey, how would you like to show him up... by beating him at his own game? [Cheering] I'm happy to report that the flow of illegal liquor seems to have dried up... public drunkenness has ceased, and those mysterious liquor clouds... over Evergreen Terrace are gone. People, Rex Banner has won your war against alcohol! [Cheering] What about the Beer Baron? I suspect he was just an invention of the media. The idea that someone like that could operate under my very nose is laughable. [Gasping, Choking] Well, you all know what laughter sounds like. We now go live to Evergreen Terrace where I'm informed... that former Police Chief Wiggum has captured the Beer Baron. [Murmuring] They captured Homer? Then the liquor-filled bowling balls... traveled through a network of underground pipes... finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy. You forgot one thing, Wiggum. Yeah, what's that? I filled the balls with a funnel. That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum. But what's gonna happen to you? Oh, probably just a slap on the wrist. "A nd he who shall violate this law... shall be punished by catapult." [Straining] Last time I help you. Sorry. I thought you'd get a fine... or at most, three, four years in jail. Hold it! This machine is two centuries old. Better test it first. Oh! [Screeching] Okay, go ahead. Wait! Wait! You can't do this! All my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. Now, I'll admit, car crashes and fistfights have been down recently... but prohibition has cost us our freedom- our freedom to drink! [Cheering] Now, hold on a minute, missy. It's not up to us to choose which laws we want to obey. If it were, I'd kill everyone who looked at me cockeyed! Our laws are in place for a reason. Send him back to Mama, boys. [Yelling] That was unexpected. Well, reset the catapult, and let's get this over with. Wait! I have discovered more lines on the parchment. It says that the prohibition law which was passed here 200 years ago... was repealed 199 years ago. Release the prisoner! Oh! On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize and ask... how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again? Well, sorry. I'm not in that business anymore. Four minutes. [Narrator] And so one town's briefflirtation with prohibition... ended in a joyous remarriage to Lady Liquor. Congratulations, Springfield. We wish you the very best! To alcohol, the cause of and solution to... all of life's problems.

Seymour, you're heaven in Hush Puppies. [Groaning] Turn the music off! Ha! It's working like a charm, boys. Now, cut the power and hit 'em with the lights! [Relays Clicking] ♪ [Continues] [Groaning] Ugh! [Ringing] [Grunting] I'll get it. [Rings] Talk to me. You have got to end this thing, Seymour. We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated... and you acknowledge and celebrate our love. No one would like to celebrate your love more than I. But I am a public servant, and not permitted to use my own judgment in any way. Then let us take our case directly to the townspeople. Oh, yeah. That'll be real productive. Who do you want to talk to first? The guy in the bumblebee suit... or the one with the bone through his hair? My opinions are as valid as the next man's! Yeah, all right. Just come on down. [Beeps] Well, this is it. What are you going to do? I'm going to go out there... and tell every man, woman and child that I love Edna Krabappel! Well, that's nice. But first you gotta grab their attention. And I think I know how. I have a bomb! [All Gasping] Hey, wait a minute! Those are hot dogs! Armour Hot Dogs! What kind of man wears Armour Hot Dogs? It was a good idea, Bart. But it's just not working. Just speak from the heart, Seymour. Tell them how we brought a little happiness into each other's lives. Ask them why they're forcing two dedicated people... to choose between their careers and their hearts! Excuse me, Edna. I don't think we're talking about love here. We're talking about S-E-X in front of the C-H-l-L-D-R-E-N. s*x Cauldron? I thought they closed that place down! What are you people talking about? My child told me you two were having s*x in the school janitor's closet. You know, making babies! Yes! Illicit s*x! Doing "it!" "It!" "It!" Sordid, public, sexual congress! This is absurd! I did not have relations in that closet! And the fact is, I haven't- [Gasps] Uh- Yes? Seymour, I think you'd better tell them. It's the only way to clear our names. [Clicks Tongue, Exhales] Well, everyone... the fact is, I haven't ever had relations. I am a virgin. Ha-ha! [Muttering] Hey! Does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin too? [Nelson] Ha! Well, Seymour, it's clear you've been falsely accused... because no one, anywhere, ever... would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Oh, that's for sure! I'm inclined to agree. Ach! I'll never look at him the same again. That was more than I wanted to know. [Clearing Throat] Okay, well, um- Edna, Seymour, in light of these, uh, revelations... I suppose we overreacted. Do we have our jobs back? What? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure. Just, uh, you know, keep the lewdness to a minimum. [Whispering, Indistinct] I'm outta here! Skinny, Crabby, catch you later. Uh, hold on, Bart. May we have a word with you? We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult period. Oh! No problemo. So, I guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh? Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up. Huh? We can't continue on like this... trying to build a private relationship in public- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb- Mm-hmm. I'm used to humiliation. But not in front of a crowd that size. Oh, but you seemed like such a good couple. Bart, when you get a little older... you're going to learn that sometimes romances don't turn out... exactly the way you'd like them to. Hmm. That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. [Laughing] [Both Laughing] [Champagne Cork Pops] [Edna] Whoo! Oh, Seymour!

Smell it. Oh, Bart, you didn't have to do that. [Sniffs] Ohh! And for Homer- Wow! A golf shirt with my corporate logo on it. [Sniffs] Oh! It smells like salmon too. Thanks, boy.

I don't need pep pills to be suspicious. If I want to comment on it, I'll comment on it. Who's gonna stop me? You, Pep Pill Boy? Pep Boys, pills, Beverly Sills. [Clicks Tongue] Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

That's not Santa's Little Helper! That's Laddie. Bart says he won him at a church carnival two towns over. In a truth-telling contest, right, Bart? Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes. Wow! I gotta start going to church. What do you got for me, boy? Hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat. Oh, yeah. A dog like this you have to feed every day. He's trained to do all sorts of stuff. He can herd sheep and perform C.P.R. "Some call it the dog that never sleeps... though it actually does while jogging." Geez! That dog has more education than I do. He's some kind of super dog! Hey, where'd he go? [Toilet Flushing] Whoa! Wow. [Rings] Hello? Man: Hello, Mr. Halper. I'm calling from Money Bank Credit Services Department. I was wondering if you had a chance to read the threatening letter we sent you. Uh- Because you sound like a mature, responsible person... who wouldn't want an unpaid credit card bill... to spoil all his hopes and dreams for the future- dreams such as home ownership, boat ownership and event attendance. Now, when can I tell my supervisor, Mr. Robinson, to expect payment? [Dial Tone Hums] Good dog. Come on, boy! Let's go for a walk! [Gasps] No, not you. Laddie. [Whines] Come on. I got a job for you. [Whines] Good boy. We didn't see nothin' if you didn't see nothin'. [Gasps] Oh, no! Repo men! Laddie, hide behind that bush there! Mom and Dad aren't home, are they? No. They went for a walk with the Flanders. Bart, what's going on? Why are those repo guys taking all your stuff? The dog and I got a credit card, and- Credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good. So I committed a little mail fraud. Haven't I been punished enough? Hey, stop! You can take back the bassinet, but the baby's ours! And the last item is one $1,200 dog. Is that him? [Growling] Well, is he the dog or isn't he? [Gulps] Yeah. That's him, all right. [Panting] [Whines] Sorry, boy. I didn't plan this. It just sort of happened. [Tires Screech] Mom, can I feed Laddie at the table? Oh, it's against the house rule. Oh, I guess just this once. I don't know about this dog. He's kinda snooty. Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie? Do you think he noticed? [Groans] Where's Santa's Little Helper? Who? Um, I took him to a kennel two towns over just till the new dog gets settled. We wrecked the first dog. We've gotta treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk? No. Bart had his turn. Let me! I can't resist his charms. Let's all walk Laddie! Hey, this park is great! How come we never take Santa's Little Helper here? Crowds give him gas. Besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with Bart. Uh, yeah. Hey, that is one fine-looking animal you got there! Wow! TV's Kent Brockman. [Laughs] Hey, this fella's not available to stud, is he? You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman? No, no. Jessica's been fixed. She just needs a little- [Clicks Tongue] attention. Why, that canine has the proud bearing and glossy fur coat of a Yale man. Hello, little fella. Smithers, I believe this dog was in Skull and Bones. Whoa! Cool dog! Can he catch a Frisbee? [Barking] [Cheering] Boy, Bart! Laddie's the best dog in the world! He's nothing like your old dog. Santa's Little Helper? Guess I was the only one who loved him. You got that right! Remember the time he ate my goldfish, and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But why did I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl? Yeah. He was a great dog. Oh, Santa's Little Helper, I was crazy to give you up for another dog. What have I done to you? [Horn Blows] [British Accent] Captain, can't we go any faster? I greatly fear we shan't be in Wimbledon by noonfall. No worries, madam. Lumley, shovel on more dogs, won't you? Aye, aye. More dogs! [Bells Jingling] - More dogs! [Panting] In you go! [Gasps] Nah. That's not too likely. But still, you're gone. Where are you, boy? [Ship Horn Blows] "Time for a walk." Oh, again? I gotta find out where he's keeping these. I'd take him, but those cards are nontransferable. [Groans] Woman: Help! Help! [Barking] Now what? Come on. I want to go home. So, Laddie, thank you for your heroic rescue. And, Baby Gerald... we can't help but wonder what mischief you'll get into next. [Crowd Applauding] Now can we go home? Laddie saved the day, Simpson. Boy, we sure could use a dog like that on the force! Why don't you guys take him? I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake. Really? No foolin'? Ah, gee! Thanks, mister. We'll take real good care of him. And we'll play with him every day, honest! [Sighs] Oh, Maggie! You got oatmeal all over. Homie, would you clean her off? Can do! Laddie! [Whistles] Come here, boy! Who wants to lick a messy baby? Laddie? Uh, Dad? Laddie's not coming. I gave him away. What's the matter, Bart? Weren't you happy with him? No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog. He'd better know how to keep his mouth shut. Well, if that's what you think is best... let's just go down to the kennel and get Santa's Little Helper back. Uh, we can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away too, and I don't know where he is. You gave both dogs away? You know how I feel about giving! I'm sorry. I know it's wrong. I messed everything up! And now I don't have any dogs at all! There, there. Shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog. I don't want a new dog! I want Santa's Little Helper! Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back... unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food... until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back... or you can go out there and find your dog! You're right! I'll do it! Rats! I almost had him eatin' dog food. I'm going to get the dog back. Homer: The bad dog or the good dog? The bad dog. Oh, good. You gotta give me back my floor! My customers are walking around on the pipes. Hey, next time pay your bills. But I don't want to! Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess this dog from a guy named Santos L. Halper? Yeah. Yeah, I remember this mutt. We sold him to some guy wearing a dress. No, I didn't buy your dog. I gotta go keep an eye on Selma. She thinks she swallowed a Band-Aid. [Gagging] Yeah, I bought your mutt, and I ate him! [Gasps] I 'ate his little face, I 'ate his guts... and I 'ate the way he's always barking! So, I gave him to the church. Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church. Aye. I also 'ate the mess he left on me rug. Ya heard me! Mmm, yes, I remember Satan's Little Helper... littering the rectory with his dirt, biting me in the apse. He unholied the holy water! That's him, all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands. Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible, Bart. He's no longer among us. [Gasps] You didn't crucify him? [Laughing] No. He's safely with one of our parishioners. I'll give you his address if you like. And then buy somethin' or get out! Angel. ♪ [Piano] Hey, it's him! It's Santa's Little Helper! [Whines] [Buzzes] Man: Yes? My name is Bart Simpson. I have to talk to you about your dog.

How can I help you? You're the guy who owns the dog? Yup. His name's Sprinkles. Sprinkles? Yeah, he's my best buddy, huh? Especially since my parrot decided to stop talking. Polly? Polly, want to say hi to our guest? Huh? Fine. Be that way. Now, what can I do for you, son? Oh, nothin'. Forget it. So, that's my plan. I'm gonna break into the blind man's yard and swipe the dog. Hmm! Bart, that is a new low. Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna be a dance around the maypole! I won't tell Mom and Dad, but only because I want the dog back. Just try not to freak out the blind man. I can't promise I'll try, but I'll try to try. [Whistles] Here, boy! Come on! [Groans] [Liquid Splashing] Eww! Psst! [Whines, Excited Panting] Oh, I missed you so much, boy. Come on.

#08x21 - The Old Man and Lisa^[Man On TV] And now the thrilling conclusion of Colonel Dracula Joins the Navy. [Man 2] Uh, Colonel? [Dracula Shouts] [Rattling Continues] Hmm? Lisa, what in the heck are you doing? Oh. It's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling. Ah, recycling is useless, Lise. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You're just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products. Well, I think it's a great idea. Mom, Mom! You're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane. Marge! Well, I'm sorry! And you have to cut these up first, otherwise animals get caught in them. Only the stupid ones. I could still use more paper. Hey. I know where there's lots of paper. [Chuckling] Dad, you're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious. Oh. Okay. [Sobbing] Skinner: What a load of garbage. I'm ecstatic. With the money from this... we're within striking distance of our trip to Albany. [Cheering] Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker. I know he can teach us a lot about business. Mr. C. Montgomery Burns. I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital... or sitting in some phony-baloney church. Or synagogue. Questions? Well, uh, I'm gonna take advantage of this rare opportunity... even if you children aren't interested. Uh, which do you think is more important? Hard work or stick-to-itiveness? Are there any real questions? Yes. Um, does your plant have a recycling program? Re-cy-cling? I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term, you adorable little ragamuffin. Hmm. You never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources. Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor. Well, maybe she should have thought of that... when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison monkeys. Nature started the fight for survival, and now she wants to quit because she's losing. Well, I say hard cheese. But nature's not our enemy. Well, surely you agree we can do without her. No, I don't agree. No? How dare you question Mr. Burns. I'll handle it, Smithers. [Chuckles] Shut up, little girl. If I had spent my life listening to dismal Doras like you... I wouldn't be worth $200 million today. But according to your most recent biography you only have $100 million today. I, uh- l- [Stutters] Um, actually, sir... it's, uh, considerably less than that. I, um, have to go. Monty Burns, everybody. I've called you all here because I need some honest answers. What is my current financial situation? [Both] Great. I hear "great." All right. Let's have a look at my stock portfolio. Hmm. Confederated Slave Holdings. How's that doing? It's, uh, uh, steady. I'm sure all your stocks are doing well, sir. After all, you chose them. [All] Mm-hmm. Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look. [Grunts] Here's where I stopped checking it last time. September, 1929. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Smithers, why didn't you tell me about this market crash? Um, well, sir, it happened 25 years before I was born. Oh, that's your excuse for everything. I've got to do something to get my money back quickly. This calls for an aggressive trading strategy. [All] Good idea, sir. Take 50% of my money, and put it in the blue chips- Transatlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats... Congreve's lnflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore opera hat company. That should set things right again, eh, boys? Absolutely. Genius. Oh, yes, sir. "A" all the way. Can't go wrong with Congreve's. [All Clearing Throats] [Grunting] A half ton of newspaper, and all we get is 75 cents? That won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles. It sounds like you're working for your car. Simplify, man. Oh- [Scoffs] Sorry, kids. The trip to Albany is off, and there's to be no more recycling. [All Groaning] But we didn't do that badly. We collected enough paper to save one whole tree. [All Sobbing] [Ralph] Oh, Mommy, help. Hmm. Are you saying my money's all gone? [All] Mm-hmm. But... I made all the right moves, didn't I? [All] Yes. Every move a right one. I see it all now. You're just a bunch of yes-men. I was making the wrong moves, and you were too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right? [All] Yes. Dead on, sir. Then I'll fix this myself. Smithers, take out another mortgage on the plant. Well, the bank has already foreclosed on the plant. A-And your house, sir. But... what will I do? Well, the first thing you'll have to do is move out of the bank's house. I'll help you pack. [Whimpers] Oh. [Faucet Squeaks] Go on. Get out of here. [Squawking] And I'm sure a pro wrestler such as yourself will appreciate all the closet space, Hitman. [Sniffs] Ew. This place has got old man stink. Ooh. Oh, don't listen to him, sir. You've got an enchanting musk. And you wouldn't even be the only wrestler in the neighborhood. The Shrieking Sheik lives just three doors away. [Man Shrieking] [Laughs] Hey! I'll take it. Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times. Why would I want a picture of a pitiful pencil-neck geek? [Sighs] Why indeed. I'll make sure he forwards your social security check, sir. [Burns] Mmm. Excellent. Homer! You didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant! Now, I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day. You told me about that candy bar you found three times. You found a candy bar? Oh, yes. Gather round, my son... and I shall tell you a tale. I normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes... but on behalf of the recycling community, ha! Couldn't happen to anyone more deserving. They're not going to close the plant, are they? No. The bank put Lenny in charge. [Clock Ticking] Uh, attention, everybody. Uh- [Sighs] Oh-Work harder. Bye. [Knuckles Crack] [Sighs] Well, sir, I have to get to work. Lenny's a real bear on tardiness. Are there any chores I can do? [Smashing] Uh, no, no. Uh... you just stay here and maintain your dignity. [Door Closes] [Water Dripping] Ah. Here's a chance to earn my keep. I will go out and get these items from the food jobber. Grocery store, please. I am riding on a bus. Hey. Aren't you that guy everybody hates? Oh, my, no. I'm Monty Burns. [Wheels Squeaking] ♪ [Muzak] I'm shopping. Hmm. Cer- Oh, my. I wonder which is the cereal for me. Um- Oh, excuse me. Could you tell me where I might find the Burns O's? Sorry, pops. They don't put nobodies on cereal boxes. Hmm. Well... I suppose this one looks a bit like me. Oh. Thank you, shoppie. l- I ventured in to search for milk when the door snapped shut behind me. Yeah. Those dairy cases are death traps. [Burns] "Ketchup." "Catsup." "Ketchup." "Catsup." "Catsup." K- K- Oh, I'm in way over my head. He's, uh, talking to the ketchup now. Burns is sure acting nutty. Maybe going broke and losing his plant destroyed his brain. Could you come along with us, sir? Are you here to solve my ketchup problem? Yes. That's right. Wh-Where are you taking me? What's happening? Relax. You've gone off your nut... so we're stuffing you into an old folks' home. Those, uh, store guys signed the commitment papers. But I'm shopping. [Homer Glugging] [Sighs] Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling- [Hiccups] I can handle today. Dad, if you just drink one more I'll have a full bag. Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good. [Groans] There's gotta be more trash around here somewhere. Hey. Why don't you try the old folks' home? They practically live in their own filth. Thanks, Dad. You're welcome, honey. That's the activity room. We're not allowed in there. That's the library. Not allowed in there either. And don't even think about going in the game room. Egad, man. How are we supposed to pass the time? Best bet is to stake yourself out a good spot at the starin' window.

It doesn't matter what your name is, you idiot. What I want to know is will you help me get my money back? Ha. I'd never help you. You're the worst man in the world. Yes.

No. [Doorbell Rings] Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns... and I want your daughter to help make me rich again. You mean Maggie? Ah. The baby who shot me. No. I was referring to your other daughter. Lisa. You have a guest. So, uh... how's life in the gutter? You again? I've realized the error of my ways, Lisa. I need someone with your integrity to help me. Please don't refuse this poor old man.

It's a deal. See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals? [Whining] I'll do it this afternoon. You mean there are actually people... who will pay good money for garbage? Not good money really. Each can'll get you a nickel. Oh, don't pooh-pooh a nickel, Lisa. A nickel will buy you a steak and kidney pie... a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake and a newsreel- with enough change left over to ride the trolley... from Battery Park to the Polo Grounds. There's a can. You have to cut these six-pack holders up, otherwise fish get trapped in them. I see. Ha-ha! My first dollar! Thanks to you, Lisa- and our hemp-smoking friend. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Sounds like somebody's living in the past. Contemporize, man! Well, Lisa, as my adviser, you're entitled to 10%. Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations... will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments. There's a can. [Kent Brockman] And from our "it's funny when it happens to them" file... remember millionaire C. Montgomery Burns... the man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985? Well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living. Please be Flanders. Please be Flanders. Please be Flanders. Excuse me, Mr. Burns. Now that you're completely ruined, how do you feel? Excellent. I'm on my way back to the top. I've turned these cans into "can do." Well, you smell terrible. Good luck to you, sir. Wow. He went from stinking rich to just plain stinking. [All Laughing] Good one, Mom. Oh, you're so bad, honey. You guys shouldn't laugh at him. Mr. Burns has changed. He's different now. Yeah. He's broke. [Laughing] Two in a row! [Groans] Oh, you've really turned my life around these past few weeks, Lisa. I've got my own business again, my beloved employees. Oh, consarn it. Uh, come on! Let's pick up the pace, you neglected old nincompoops. Mr. Burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. You have to show them they're appreciated. Oh. Capital idea, partner. People, if we meet this week's quota... I'll take you to the most duck-filled pond you ever sat by. Oh, hot diggety! That's how they got me to vote for Lyndon LaRouche. Wow. Even I didn't know he was so committed to recycling. See? I told you Mr. Burns has changed. See? Lisa, nobody likes a gloater. Right, Homie? Uh-huh. See? [Applause] Yes. Thank you, everyone. But... 10% of your applause... should go to my little partner, Lisa Simpson. For, if it were not for her infectious moralizing, we would not be here today... to witness the unveiling of... the Li'I Lisa Recycling Plant. Oh, ain't that cute? Makes Li'I Debbie look like a pile of puke. Would you like to be the first to take a tour of the plant, Li'I Lisa? I'd love to, partner. The whole plant is environmentally sound. It's powered by old newspapers, the machinery is made entirely of used cans... and the windows are from the old liquor bottles we collected. Hey! I thought I told you to stop licking my windows. I know. You told me. And when I woke up this morning, I said, "Barney, you're not gonna lick that man's-" I'm so proud of you, Mr. Burns. You're getting your fortune back... and you're doing it without endangering the planet... or cozying up to the Aspen crowd. Oh, hold your accolades till the end of the tour. You haven't seen the best part. I couldn't watch your demonstration of the fish caught in the plastic rings... without getting an idea. Look out over the water. I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish... a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch. What's going on? [Chuckles] I call it the Burns Omni-Net. It sweeps the sea clean. [Gasps] Oh, dear God. I call our product Li'I Lisa's Patented Animal Slurry. It's a high-protein feed for farm animals... insulation for low-income housing... a powerful explosive and a top-notch engine coolant. And best of all, it's made from 100% recycled animals. [Groans] I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, a spoonful of slurry will cure what ails ya. Oh! You haven't changed at all! You're still evil. And when you're trying to be good, you're even more evil. I don't understand. Pigs need food. Engines need coolant. Dynamiters need dynamite. I'm supplying it to them at a tidy profit. And not a single sea creature was wasted. You inspired it all, Li'I Lisa. [Gasping] [Gasps] Oh! You- [Panting] Stop! Don't recycle! It's murder! You're helping Mr. Burns! [Monotone] But you told us to recycle. [Monotone] You convinced us it was good. No. It's evil. Please! Stop recycling! [Monotone] Stop. You can't mix plastic with paper. [Grunts, Gasps] Oh! Oh! [Tires Screech] [Horns Honking] [Sobbing] [Groans] I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes. Oh, I was a fool to help that horrible old man. I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone. [Doorbell Rings] Simpson, what are you doing here? Why aren't you at work? I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was, so I'm watching TV. Well, Lenny's reign of terror is over. Mr. Burns bought the plant back this morning. And- Enough chitchat. I need to see Lisa. I don't want to talk to you, Mr. Burns. Oh, I think you will. You see, I've just sold the Li'I Lisa Recycling Plant for $120 million. Congratulations. Oh, don't congratulate me. Congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks. As my adviser, you're entitled to 10% of the proceeds. [All Gasp] Lise, have I told you lately that I love you? Wow. I've never seen so much money. Oh, but I can't accept that, knowing where it came from. Can I, Mom? [Groans] Lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you. [Moans] [Groans] Oh, you did the right thing, sweetheart. [Beeping] [Laughing] Well, that's the first case I've ever seen... of a man suffering four simultaneous heart attacks. I'm sorry, Dad. It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that $12,000. Um, Dad, 10% of $120 million isn't 12,000. It's- [Rapid Beeping] [Woman On P.A.] Code blue. Code blue.

Then, on his I (th birthday... he was blown up in a silo explosion. During his long recuperation, he taught himself to hear... and feel pain again. As the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day... to study science by mail. And, last week, Frank Grimes... the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got... received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics- with a minor in determination.

I want to make him my executive vice president. Yes, sir. Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car... then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president. Uh, yes, sir. In the meantime, here's Frank Grimes. [Clears Throat] The self-made man? What? Oh, yes, that fellow. Just put him somewhere out of the way. And find that dog. Yes, sir. [Groans] Chair goes round.

I live in a single room above a bowling alley... and below another bowling alley. Wow. I'm sorry. Isn't that- Yeah, that's me, all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins. Oh! And here's a picture of me in outer space. You... went into outer space? You? Sure. You've never been? Would you like to see my Grammy award? No! I wouldn't. God. I've had to work hard every day of my life... and what do I have to show for it? This briefcase and this haircut. And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance? What? Everything! A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife... a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes and- [Sniffing] lobsters for dinner. And do you deserve any of it? No! [Gasps] What are you saying? [Laughs] I'm saying... you're what's wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible... and you leach off decent, hard-working people- like me. [Laughs] If you lived in any other country in the world... you'd have starved to death long ago. He's got you there, Dad. You're a fraud-A total fraud. It was nice meeting you. [Door Slams] [All Groan] [Milhouse] Wow! Adding machines. Industrial waste. What should we do with all this stuff, Bart? I think we both know the answer to that. [Sighs] [Pounding] Get to work! [Together] Wacky shack! Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs. Solve your problem, Milhouse? Yep. [Both Laughing] Hmm? Homer? Homer, why aren't you at work? The car won't start. I don't feel very good today. I am at work. You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you? Well, that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road! [Honks] You'll have to face him sometime, and when you do... I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are. No, he won't. He hates me. He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily... and it's been so difficult for him. Yeah! Yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy. It's about him being a crazy nut. Well, maybe- But I'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... mmm, professional in your work. [Gasps] Just a little more. Then he won't have any reason to resent you. I'll do it. To professionalism. Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later... during a designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson. [Alarm Blaring] Can you believe that guy? He's in his office making a pathetic attempt to look professional. Hey, what do you got against Homer anyway? Are you kidding? Does this whole plant have some disease... where it can't see that he's an idiot? Look here. Accidents have doubled every year since he became safety inspector. And meltdowns have tripled. Has he been fired? No. Has he been disciplined? No, no. Aw, everybody makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils. Yeah, Homer's okay. Give him a break. No! Homer is not okay- And I want everyone in this plant to realize it. I would die a happy man if I could prove to you... that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old. So. How you doin'? [Groans] Hmm? Oh, here we go. Mm-hmm. Oh! "Design your own power plant," eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am. Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I'm going home to work on the contest. [Snickering] [Snickering Continues] Oh, God! [Power Tool Whining] [Homer Shouting, Indistinct] Ow! [Shouting] Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing? I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand. Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles? [Pounding] [Grunting] [Whistling] Oh, boy! Quittin' time! Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight... so it doesn't get trashed. How'd you like to be night watchman? But I'm sleepy. Oh, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine. [Squeaking] So this is my life. At least I've done better than Dad. [Whistling, Gasps] Aw, geez! Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman. I was watching. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over, and then it fell over. Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go. [Chittering] Moe: Okay, everybody tuck your pants into your socks. And the bold new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today... could make thousands of jobs like yours... obsolete. [Scattered Applause] Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum. [Chuckles] It's pretty good, sir. Hot tub, media room- It's supposed to be a power plant, not Aunt Beulah's bordello. Thank you. Get out. Next. [Wiggum] Uh, Ralphie, get off the stage, sweetheart. Behold-The power plant of the future... today. [Groans] Too cold and sterile. Where's the heart? But it really generates power. It's lighting this room right now. [Electronic Whine] You lose. Get off my property. Let's have the next child. Look, everybody. Simpson's in a contest with children. Hey, shh! You're making us miss the contest. Could you explain your model, young man? What's to explain? He's an idiot! [Lenny] Pipe down! Well, basically, I just copied the plant we have now. Hmm. Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance- And this racing stripe here, I feel is pretty sharp. Agreed. First prize. What? Way to go, Homer. You're number one, Homer. But this was a contest for children! Yeah-And Homer beat their brains out. [Cheers, Applause] I can't stand it any longer. This whole plant is insane. Insane, I tell you! [Stammers, Screams] [Whimpering] I can be lazy too. Look at me. Hi. I'm a worthless employee, just like Homer Simpson. Give me a promotion. Ooh, I eat like a slob, but nobody minds. [Chomping] I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise. Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands- But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson. I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. D'oh, d'oh, d'oh. Hey, you okay, Grimey? I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson. [Laughs] You wish. Oh, hi, Mr. Burns. I'm the worst worker in the world. Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster. What's this? "Extremely high voltage." Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp- Frank Grimes- or "Grimey," as he liked to be called- taught us that a man can triumph over adversity... and even though Frank's... agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short... I am sure he's looking down... - [Snoring] from heaven right now- [Continues, Indistinct][/i] Change the channel, Marge. [Mourners Laughing] That's our Homer.
#08x24 - The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase^Spin-off! Is there any word more thrilling to the human soul? Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such TV spin-offs as Son of Sanford and Son and After Mannix. I'm here at the Museum ofTV and Television... with a real treat for Simpsons fans, if any... because tonight we present The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase. ♪ [Theme] [Applause] Not long ago, the Fox network approached the producers of The Simpsons... with a simple request- 35 new shows to fill a few holes in their programming lineup. That's a pretty daunting task. And the producers weren't up to it. Instead, they churned out three Simpsons spin-offs... transplanting already popular characters into new locales and situations. First up, a gritty crime drama... starring Springfield's beloved Police Chief Wiggum. Keep at least one eye open. 'Cause his best friends, the Simpsons, just might pop in to wish him luck. Let's us wish him luck too. Good luck, Wiggum! ♪ [Theme] Ah, New Orleans. The Big Easy. Sweet Lady Gumbo. Old... Swampy. I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small-town police chief... to set up a detective shop in New Orleans? Oh, lots of reasons, I suppose. Got kicked off the force for one thing. For massive corruption. For massive- Exactly. Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here on the mean streets of New Orleans. Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield. But, in my heart, I've- I've always been a small-time hustler. I know. That's precisely why I hired you as my legman, Skinny Boy. I want you to put the word out. Chief Wiggum is here to clean up this crime dump. Bleh! Looks like you've already got an enemy, Chief. You know, folks around here don't much care for law and order types. Is that right? Well, maybe they'll change their minds... once I arrest them for throwing skulls all over my floor. Hmm. Oh, man, what a day. It's no cakewalk being a single parent... juggling a career and a family like so many juggling balls. Two, I suppose. Daddy, these rubber pants are hot. You wear 'em until you learn, Son. I guarantee! Will you stop saying that? So, Skinner, who do you figure threw that skull through my window? What's the word on the street? Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although, uh, according to an article I read in Parade magazine- Mm-hmm. a criminal by the name of "Big Daddy" runs this town. Big Daddy, eh? Well, he won't feel so big... if he messes with Chief Wiggum, P.I. again. Which I sincerely doubt he will. [Snoring] [Giggling] Hey! Oh, God! [Grunting] Lucky for you this was just a warning gator. The next one won't be corked. Listen up, Big Daddy! You don't scare me! I'm three steps ahead of you! Skinner: Oh, Chief, your boy's been kidnapped. Oh, God! Big Daddy's trademark calling card. See? It's right here inside the skull. [Rattling] Looks like we've got our first case ever, Skinny Boy. And this time, it's personal. Announcer: Chief Wiggum P.I. will return... right now. [Rings] Who is this? It's me, Chief. I'm on the other extension. Now you listen up, mon ami, and you listen good, yeah? The name's Daddy. Charles Daddy. Big Daddy! What have you done with my boy, Daddy? Ah, the boy is fine, so far. I taught him to play the spoons. [Clinking] If you ever want to see that boy again... I suggest you leave town today, hear? [Dial Tone] Huh. Sounded like some sort of party going on in the background. Are there any parties today, Skinner? Nah, it's not really a party town. Though, if I remember correctly... they occasionally hold a function called Mardi-something. [Cheering] ♪ [Jazz] ♪ [Continues] Aah. [Sinister Laughing] [Screams] [Laughing] Huh? Well, if it isn't my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons! What brings you folks to New Orleans? Mardi Gras, man. When The Big Easy calls, you gotta accept the charges. Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures... you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop. Well, golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't seen him, have you? Caucasian male between the ages of six and 10, thinning hair. Over there. Look, Big Daddy, it's regular Daddy. The chief! Ooh, I suppose I'd best to run! Lord have mercy, I wish I weren't so fat. [Grunting] Police business! Hang on, Son. I'm coming- Ow! Ow! Gee, my tongue. [Screaming] Ha, ha! Na, na! ♪ [Whistles] What do you suppose the rent is on a hideout like that? Ah, it's not rented, Chief. It's stolen. That's the Louisiana Governor's Mansion. It's been missing for eight months. [Gasps] You! Welcome to ma maison, Chief. I've been expecting you. Is that so, Big Daddy? Well, expect this! The arrest of you by me. Mes chers, New Orleans is my town. Won't nobody gonna mess with me. I got interests. And I ain't talking about stamp collecting. Though, I do find that extremely interesting. Oh, yeah? Well, that makes two of us. You know, boys... there is an old saying down on the bayou that, uh- Whee! He's gradually getting away, Chief. Ah, let him go. I have a feeling we'll meet again each and every week... always in more sexy and exciting ways. Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be just like you. Better start eating, kid. Start eating? [All Laughing] I didn't mean it that way. Oh, hi. Welcome back to our Spin-Off Showcase. Could The Simpsons ever have maintained its popularity without Moe the bartender? Let's hope so, because Moe's leaving to do his own sitcom. But don't panic. He's taking a familiar sidekick with him. And his best friend Homer might just pop in to wish him luck. Let's take a peek. Well-Ahh- I better go. I got a date with that lady in front of the drug store who's always yelling things. She told me she was washing her hair tonight. [Sighs] I'm so desperately lonely. [Audience Laughing] Grampa: Oh, quit your bellyaching, you big loser! Wh-Who said that? I did! It's me, Abe Simpson! But you're d-d-d-dead. I was. But I've come back as your love testing machine. I'm The Love-Matic Grampa! [Screams] ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Continues] ♪ [Ends] Don't be afraid, Moe. I'm here to help you with your romantic problems. Hey, I don't need no advice from no pinball machine. I'll have you know I wrote the book on love. Yeah, All Quiet on the Western Front. [Audience Oohs] Ah, kiss my dishrag. [Audience Laughing] See? That's your problem. You're a crab. Ladies like sweet-talkers. Hey, I'm sweet. I'm sweeter than Jewish wine. Then prove it! I want you to charm... the next pretty young thing that walks through that door. Mmm, greetings! [Audience Laughing, Cheering, Applauding] Son, it's me. I floated up toward heaven but got lost along the way. [Gasps] Dad, is that really you? Darn tootin', you lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son- [Electricity Crackles] Call me when you get a karaoke machine. [Audience Laughing] [Whirs] That's the second time he pulled the plug on me. [Footsteps Approaching] I was just in a car accident. Can I use your phone? Uh, using the phone's a four-drink minimum. Uh-uh! What's the matter? I'm making as nice as I can. Test lady. Test lady. Go ahead, give it a try. It goes by how clammy your hands are. Well, I suppose I could use a laugh after that accident. [Dinging] Lovelorn. You need man. Moe near now. Go near Moe. What? "Go near Moe." I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement. So how about you and me go out sometime? You know, out back? [Imitates Buzzer] I mean, uh, out to dinner at a fancy French restaurant? Bing! Sounds great. And if this Love Tester is as accurate as it looks... maybe we'll be having breakfast too. [Audience Cheering] You did it, Grampa! You really are a love expert! Dang right. Fact is, I invented kissing. It was during World War I, and they were looking for a new way to spread germs. [Chattering] [Audience Laughing] Sorry, Grampa. But I gotta stash you in the bathroom... so Betty won't get wise to us. [Whirs] This is not the evening I envisioned. Whoa! She just got here. Give me some advice, quick. Uh, you know, just be sweet. Pour on the honey, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, romantic. Uh, ain't sunshine pretty? Ain't flowers stupid? I gotcha. [Sighs] I've suffered so long. Why can't I die? You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking attractive and desirable. l-It's just so rare and refreshing. So, Moe, tell me a little about yourself. Myself. Uh, geez. Um, I gotta go to the can again. Huh? I got the runs. [Grunting] Hey, get away from that! Leave him alone! It said I was gay! [Audience Laughing] You all right, Grampa? ♪ [Singing Slowly] ♪ [Ends] Will you quit your clowning? I need help here. [Clanking] Ohh! Tell her her rump's as big as the queen's... and twice as fragrant! Okay. You are absolutely, positively the dumbest... [Audience Laughing] haunted Love Tester that I have ever met! [Gasps] What is going on in here? Um, uh, oh, uh, I might as well come clean with ya. I ain't too good at talking to women, and I really wanted to do ya... so I brought along the Love Tester to help me. As you may have guessed, it's inhabited by the ghost of my friend's dead father. Why, you conniving, devious... monstrous, despicable, sweet little angel. But, Betty, it you'd just give me a chance-What? I can't believe you went to all that trouble for me. [Audience Oohing, Whistling] Ding, ding, ding, ding! [Both Laughing] [Together] Thanks, Grampa. Yeah, yeah. Now how's about introducing me to that cute little pay phone out front? [Both Laughing] [Audience Laughing, Applauding] He's horny. ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Ends] Welcome back. I'm talking with the curator of the museum ofTV and Television, Mr. John Winslow. In our final spin-off tonight... the Simpson family finally gets the chance to show off the full range of their talents. Unfortunately, one family member didn't want that chance and refused to participate. But thanks to some creative casting, you won't even notice. Show us what you got, TV. Live from Radio City Music Room in downtown Springfield... it's The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour. Featuring the Waylon Smithers Dancers... and the Springfield Baggy Pants Players. And now, a family that doesn't know the meaning of the word "canceled'... the Simpsons! [Cheering, Applauding] ♪ [Singing] Roll call! Remember me? My name is Marge. The TV mom whose hair is large. [Sucking] Step back, Mom. It's Bart's turn now. Eat my shorts. Don't have a cow. I'm Lisa, peppy, blonde and stunning. Sophomore prom queen five years running. Go, Lisa! Wait a minute! Whoa, whoa! ♪ [Whistles] Stop the music! Where's Dad? ♪ [Stops] Hmm. Here he is! I'm hiding from th-th-the ghost! Ghost? What ghost? B-B-Before the show... you said we were having a special "ghost" tonight. I said we were having a special "guest" tonight. Mr. Tim Conway! [Applauding] What's a Tim Conway? Oh, about a 120 pounds. [Audience Laughing] ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Ends] [Applauding] You know, Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show. Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers? Yes! And it might look something like this. Honey, I'm home! [Audience Cheering, Applauding] Hello, dear. How was work at the plant? It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree. And I've nearly chewed through it. Now, remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight. I know. And I made your favorite- "stakes!" [Audience Groans] Hey, would you two close the "dam" door? Bart! But that's where we live. A dam. Look, everybody. Maggie got her first tooth. [All Laughing] [Audience Ohh's] Okay. Now, before my boss comes... there's something important you should know. [Doorbell Rings] In a minute, Homie. I have to get the door. But, Marge! [Gasps] [Audience Laughing] Oh, was it something I said? Arr! Someone should be keelhauled for that one. [Ship's Horn Blows] I move that the last sketch be stricken from the record. Now bring in the next offender. Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities. How are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?

I'm still here. Fox wouldn't spring for a decent hotel room. [All Laughing] [Laughing] He's just kidding. We'd like to thank Fox and the good people at Budget Lodge. Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying, "As you walk down that road of life"- Hitchhike. It's faster. [All] Bart! We're like this all the time. [Together] Good night, everybody! [Cheering, Applauding] That's it for our Spin-off Showcase. But what about the show that started it all? How do you keep The Simpsons fresh and funny after eight long years? Well, here's what's on tap for season nine. Magic powers! Wedding after wedding after wedding. And did someone say long-lost triplets? Sojoin America's favorite TVfamily... and a tiny green space alien named Osmodiar that only Homer can see... on Fox this fall. It'll be out of this world. Right, Osmodiar? Damn straight, Troy, my man. [Both] Good night, America!
#08x25 - The Secret War of Lisa Simpson^Hello? Hello! We're here for the field trip. [Siren Wailing, Brakes Squeak] [Grunting] [Razor Buzzing] Sorry. Sorry. Boy, it's getting harder and harder to make it here by 10:00. [Clears Throat] We'll start the tour in a second. I've just gotta check the answering machine. [Beeping] Oh, can't anybody in this town take the law into their own hands? [Beeps] Gather round, kids. We're about to enter the museum. [Kids Groaning] Oh, man. Of crime. [Cheering] Now, what I am about to show you next may shock and educate you. Hold on to your values as we step through the looking glass... into a hippie pot party. ♪ [Rock] While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar... his old lady has a better idea. [All Gasp] That's right. She's got the "munchies" for a California cheeseburger. [Projector Clacking] [Man On Film] So, the next time you're walking on the beach... enjoying an hourglass or making cheap, low-grade windshields... think where we'd be without sand. ♪ [Chorus Singing] ♪ [Trumpet] Okay, that was the sand movie. Now, it'll just take me a second to set up our next movie. Uh, Miss Hoover, movies are a nice break... but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging? Probably. ♪ [Fanfare] [Man Narrating] The moon. For several years, she has fascinated many. But will man ever walk on her fertile surface? Democratic hopeful Adlai Stevenson says so. I have no objection to man walking on the moon. [Narrator] By 1964, experts say man will have established 12 colonies on the moon... ideal for family vacations. Once there, you'll weigh only a small percentage... of what you weigh on Earth. Slow down, tubby. You're not on the moon yet. The moon belongs to America... and anxiously awaits the arrival of our astro-men. Will you be among them? [Film Flapping] Miss Hoover, the movie's over. Where's Miss Hoover? Hey, her car's gone. Maybe she drove to the moon. It's not my nature to complain, but so far today... we've had three movies, two filmstrips... and an hour and a half of magazine time. [Scoffs] I just don't feel challenged. Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa... but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation. [Groaning] We're now in the communications room, or the comm room. [Police Radio Chatter] Uh, this is a police radio... the single most important piece of equipment in the comm room. As you can see, some of the boys like to put their banana stickers all over it. Uh, there's Chiquita. That's Del Monte. There's a Banan Co. Gorilla's Choice. [All] Hmm. Now, uh, everyone follow me to my chair... where I just need to get off of my feet for a few minutes. [Chair Squeaks] [Wiggum Sighs] Oh, I won't be getting up soon. [Amplified] Testing. [Louder] Testing. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hey. [Chuckles] [Buzzing] [Echoing] Testing. [Squawking] Testing! Testing! [Bart's Voice Echoing] Testing. Testing. [Muffled Yells] [Bart's Voice Echoing] Testing. Testing. [Yelps] [Screams] [High-pitched Ringing] [Ringing Continues] You've really done it this time, Bart! You're in for the punishment of a lifetime! When do you expect the ringing will stop? In about 10 to 15 seconds! I certainly hope so! [Ringing Stops] [Gasps] That's better. Now, about your punishment, young man. I know. I'll go to my room and think about what I did. Oh, no, your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage. You're the boss. I tell you, Chief. I just don't know what we're going to do with him. You know, you do have options. [Lawn Mower Humming] For example, there are behavior-modifying drugs. How wedded are you to the Bart you know? Not very. No! No drugs. Bart just needs a little discipline. Uh, hey, what about military school? It set my brother straight. Now he owns and operates a famous cave. Hmm, you know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right. Military school is a good idea. [Lawn Mower Humming] [Siren Blares] Wow! I can't believe we're going to Disneyland. Hey, where's all your luggage? [Tires Squeal][/i] [Cheering] You dream about this day for so long. Then when it comes, you don't know what to say. Shh. Edna, your tears say more than words ever could. [Glasses Clink] [Choking] Military school? You lied to me! Well, I'm sorry if you heard Disneyland... but I distinctly said military school. [Tires Squealing] And that's how we'll mold your boy into a productive member of society... through an intensive program of push-ups and formation marching. Well, it certainly was nice of you to accept Bart in the middle of a semester. Fortunately, we've had a couple of recent freak-outs... so that freed up a couple of bunks. Freak-outs? lf, uh, that happens... are we still charged for the entire semester? Our high standards challenge students to reach their full potential. Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the terra-cotta warriors of Xi'an. They sure are. [Groaning] That's not so disciplined. They're just children, Mr. Simpson. [Scoffs] I guess. "Truth is beauty, beauty, truth," sir. [Gasps] They're discussing poetry. Oh, we never do that at my school. But the truth can be harsh and disturbing. How can that be considered beautiful? Oh, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem. Please don't make me stay, Dad. I'll do anything you say. I'll find religion. I'll be good sometimes. Let go of my leg. No! Son, for the last time... you're staying at military school. And so am I. [Homer, Marge Gasp] This school has everything I ever wanted. Lisa, no! This place is just a jail for children. No jail can hold me. [Siren Blares] All right. Let's go over this one more time... just to make sure I understand the situation. [Clears Throat] You're a girl. Yes. Oh, gosh darn it. I just don't understand the situation. [Clears Throat] You're a girl? All I want is a chance to prove myself. Hmm. In our 185 years, we have never had a female cadet. Um, but that seems to be the way the wind is blowing these days. After all, we have female singers... female motorists. [Groans] Welcome aboard. Lisa, if you ever wanna quit and come home... I'll be here in half a jiff. I wanna quit and come home. I wanna quit and come home. Oh, honey, I heard you the first time. [Kisses] [Tires Squeal] Atten-hut! Gentlemen, we now have a girl cadet among our ranks... so we're gonna have to make a few changes. First of all, Franklin, you are no longer the girliest cadet here. [Feminine] Well, we'll see about that. Second, this is now the girls' barracks. So pack your things. You're moving in with Company "L." Company "L '"? But they smell. Yes, we've all heard the chant. Now fall out! Sorry. Sorry. I know we'll be friends. [Whimpers] Talk about getting off on the wrong foot. [Chuckles] Ooh. I can't believe they let a girl in. Don't worry. We'll drive her out of the academy. That is why God created hazing. [Thunder Rumbling] [Chattering] [Grunting] Get in there. Harder. Harder. Come on. Wimps. [Coughing] What's the matter? Don't girls like doing push-ups in the mud? Is there any answer I can give that won't result in more push-ups? [Murmuring] No. Hey, look. It's the school motto. "I'll die before I surrender, Tim." Who's Tim? Apparently Tim was somebody who was with the general... moments before he was shot in the head. Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lise. That's how they want you to feel. But if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you. Get to work! I wanna see my face in that horse's ass! Okay, that's long enough. Let's see how they're doing. [Both Screaming] Had enough? [Both Groaning] What say you, men? Has this lowly maggot passed the test? [All Cheering] Congratulations! You made it! Hey, what about me? I'm a lowly maggot. [Gunfire] Well, since you attended public school... I'm going to assume you're already proficient with small arms... so we'll start you off with something a little more advanced. [Chuckling] Four out of five, Simpson. Impressive. But you missed your last target. Did I? Ha-ha! You're a born soldier, Simpson. Too bad it doesn't run in your family. Um, could someone help me? It's stuck on auto fire. Platt, do you hear anything? No! [Gun Clicks] [Panting] Maybe you should just learn to use this. If there's a war, just blow on it and I'll come help you. [Groaning] [Beeping] I am just calling home. I am not asking to come home. [Phone Ringing] Marge, you got that? Marge! [Whimpers] Hey, go on, boy. Go get it. Answer the phone. D'oh! There's gotta be something on this thing for that thing. [Stops Ringing] Ahh. Ohh. [Beeping] [Phone Ringing] Simpson. Hot diggity! I don't care if it's bad news. Oh, Grampa, you're not busy, are you? Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first one takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole... only hours ahead of the Three Stooges. I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The following morning, I resigned my commission in the Coast Guard. The next thing I heard, there was civil war in Spain. And... that's everything that happened in my life... right up to the time I got this phone call. Uh-huh. So, anything else you wanna talk about? Oh, I'm afraid I'd just be repeating myself, honey. [Groans] Anyway, other people need to use the phone. [All] Mm-mmm. I've already talked to her for 20 damn minutes. [Groans] Hmm? Oh! [Laughing, Chattering] [Boy] You're all right. Shh. What is it? Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad. I thought we could listen to it together. Oh, gee, Lise, I'd love to, but this really isn't a good time. Bart, who you talking to? Uh- Lisa. You're talking to Lisa. I'm talking to... no one. All right. Lights out! [Stubs Foot] Aah! Damn it. Lights on! Lights on! Lights out. Lights out. [Marge On Tape] Don't worry, sweetie. It's very common to be homesick... when you're so far away from the people who love you. Okay, I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone... and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known. [Whimpers] Then went crazy as a loon. [Tape Rewinding] ♪ [Marge On Tape Singing] ♪ [Singing Continues] I'm sorry I froze you out, Lise. I just didn't want the guys to think... I'd gone soft on the girl issue. [Groans] I'm tired of being an issue, Bart. Maybe everyone would be better off if I just quit. But if you quit, it'd be like an expert knot-tier... quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot. Why'd you say that? I don't know. I was just looking at my shoelaces. Look, the point is, you're gonna make it, Lise, and I'm gonna stick by you. Don't do that. Why should we both be outcasts? Then I'll just stick by you in secret. Like a sock maker working on a top secret sock- Will you stop looking at your feet? Well, cadets, it's been a great year. You've all worked very hard, developing academic skills and general killing skills. My killing teacher says I'm a natural. But these skills are nothing without courage and stamina. Traditionally, the academy tested these virtues... by pitting you against each other in a two-day battle royale. [All Gasp] That was prior to 1957. Thank you very much, state supreme court. Consequently now, no cadet can receive a passing grade for the academic year... without first conquering this. Meet the Eliminator. That's a 150-foot hand-over-hand crawl... across a 60-gauge hemp-jute line with a blister factor of 12. The rope is suspended a full 40 feet... over a solid British acre of old-growth Connecticut Valley thorn bushes. Gentlemen, welcome to flavor country. This wasn't in the brochure. [Chattering] [Boy] Hey, Bart, come on over here. There's plenty of room. "Meet me at the Eliminator after lights out. P.S. The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you." [Groans] [Grunting] That's it, Lise. Now start crawling. [Grunting] It's too hard. My hand is slipping. [Screams] I can't do this, Bart. I'm not strong enough. I thought you came here looking for a challenge. Duh! A challenge I could do. It was worth sneaking into town. That was some good corn. Uh-oh. Uh, hey, Simpson, what are you doing out here? Nothin'. Nothin'? Doesn't look like nothin'. Oh, yeah? Well, um, what are you doing out here? Uh... also nothin'. Well, okay. Okay. Then carry on. All right, we will. [Sighs] That was close. Bees. - [Buzzing] Bees. Bees? [Screams] [Lisa Screams] [Thud] Gentlemen, I regret to inform you... that the state supreme court has determined... that forcing cadets to cross the Eliminator... is a barbaric and malicious practice. Yes! Hence... you will be the last class to be subjected to it. Anderson, you're up. [Yelling] [Bart Straining] Son of a- [Straining] Geez! [Sighs] Good job, Simpson. Although that's more cursing... than I like to hear from a cadet in peacetime. [All Congratulating] Last up- Simpson, Lisa! [Jeering] What's the matter? Are you scared? Are you scared, huh? Well, at least they're talking to me. [Gasps] [Bird Squawks] [Straining] Whoa! [Gasps] If only I were in Springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. Oh, God, I'm delirious. [Screams] [Jeering] [Straining] [Chanting] Drop! Drop! Drop! You can make it, Lisa. I know you can! Come on. I know you can do it. Just get your hands back on the rope. It's just a little further. Come on. Just a little bit more. You're doing great. That's it. Come on. Just a little bit more. I know you can do it. I believe in you. [Straining] Yes! You thought I couldn't, but I could. I did. And I could do it again. Let's do it again! Lisa, it's over. You made it. You can put your arms down. I can't. They're stuck. We're gonna make your life a living hell for the rest of the semester. But graduation's in three hours. We better go change. ♪ [Fanfare] The wars of the future... will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea. They will be fought in space. Or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And as you go forth today, remember always your duty is clear- To build and maintain those robots. Thank you. [Cheering] Well, Bart, did you make sure to return all the guns? Sir, yes, sir! Luckily I am now trained... in six additional forms of unarmed combat, sir! Well, he's got more confidence. Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence. Lisa, before you go... I want to present you with this. A medal? Thank you, sir. [Grunts] "For satisfactory completion of the second grade." Oh. Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school... we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real. [Both] Yea! [Both] Hey!
#09x01 - The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson^What? Uh-oh. Here comes the evening rush. Clear out, fellas! Oh, what a day. Good evenin', Moe. Good mornin', Moe. Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 % of all traffic accidents... are caused by you six guys. I knew we could do it! Yeah, I know. I know. But the bad news is... we gotta start havin' designated drivers. Are you kidding me? We'll choose the same way they pick the pope. Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight. Whew! Whew! No! You got the black one. Hey, everybody, I'm Peter Pants-less! I can't take this much longer. I gotta have a beer! Oh, no. Oh, no. Not tonight! Not tonight! Are you ready to get Duffed? Hey, it's Duffman... the guy in a costume that creates aWareness of Duff. Duffman wants to party down with the man who sent in... 10,000 Duff labels to bring me here today. I've got a bottomless mug of new Duff Extra Cold... for Barney Gumble! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! I can't! I'm the designated driver! Yeah, that's swell. Duff wholeheartedly supports the designated driver program. Now, who wants to party? Please! I'm trying to drive! Hey, let's go to the girls' college! No. The Playboy Mansion. Playboy Mansion! Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold. That's just drunk talk. Sweet, beautiful drunk talk. Good night, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. just slide it under the door. Yes. Tomorrow. Face it, Homer, the car is gone. Ohl. Barney ain't never comin' back. Here We are, Mr. Gumble. Huh? Thanks for the lift! Barney, where's my car? All I remember about the last two months... is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. Or maybe it was a street corner. So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I oughta punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school. Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself. Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts. Sorry, sorry. Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York. Throw it away. Nothing good has ever come out of New York City. 'Dear motorist, Your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan.' My vehicle! 'lf you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours... your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense.' Oh! I don't wanna go to New York City! Why not? New York is a hellhole! And you know how I feel about hellholes. Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to. Yeah. That's what people do in Russia. It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat... but it required a stopover in New York City. All I had to do Was Walk a feWblocks from the Rort Authority Bus Terminal... to my train at Renn Station. AnyhoW, I must'ye looked at somebody the Wrong Way... because the next thing I kneW, I Was running for my life. And that's when the CHUDs came at me. Oh, Homer, of course you'll have a bad impression of New York... if you only focus on the pimps and the CHUDs. Oh, I'd love to see New York. We could all go with the bus company's special super-sitter fare. Nine bucks? This one's on me! Great! We're all going to New York! Lousy Bart and his money. All right, New York, I'm comin' back! But you're not gettin' this! Dad, our baby pictures were in there. Don't you start! Wake up, eyeryone. We're almost there. That took too long. How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice? I just think we should've paid the extra $1 .50 and gotten a bus with restrooms. Hey. Marge, I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs! Homer! Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you. Hi. We're here! Wow! I feel like such a nobody. It's wall-to-wall landmarks. The Williamsburg Bridge. Fourth Avenue. Governors Island. Look! It's ZZ Top! You guys rock! Eh, maybe a little. Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks. Homer, you're scaring the children. Good. I don't wanna spend one extra second in this urban death maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car. The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. We'll meet you in Central Park at 5:00. Oh, all right. But not a minute later. 'Cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy. I'm on to you! 'Your yehicle is illegally parked... at One World Trade Plaza.' Hmm. Ooh! Wow! Governors Island looks so insignificant from up here. Hey, immigrants, beat it! Country's full! Okay, folks.

No. No, Lisa. They're just sleeping... upside down and inside out. Bart, no fireworks! Put that back! You're the boss. Oh, no! Chinese fire drill! Serious this time! Come on, boot guy! Oh.

Let the good times roll. ♪ [Humming] Good Lord! The rod up that mars butt must have a rod up its butt. Superintendent Chalmers, can I offer you a cup of coffee-flavored Bevarine? Yes. I take it gray, with Creamium. But first, before Skinner shows up, I have a secret announcement. In honor of Seymour's 20th year as principal... we've decided to hold a surprise tribute Friday night. It's my 20th year too. [Scoffs] The teachers' lounge is for teachers, Willy. [Groans, Scoffs] [Door Slams] And for the tribute, I need a volunteer to present an oral report... on Principal Skinner's life. Miss Hoover, which one is "oral"? Out of your mouth, Ralph. Volunteers. Thank you, Lisa. No, Miss Hoover. I'm Ralph. I only need one volunteer, Ralph. Miss Hoover, which one is "one"? Ralph and I could do the report together. It's your funeral. Miss Hoover. ♪ [Humming] Bart, why are you doing that? Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party. These are in honor of his army days. That explains the flags. What about the dog food? My theory is Skinner likes dog food. [Groans] Let's bake him a cake. Ooh! A fresh batch of America balls! [Chomping Loudly] Woman: Seymour, tell me what time it is, now! 7:00, Friday night, Mother. Time for our weekly silhouette. No! Cutting out your ugly nose gives me a hand cramp! Oh, but you love silhouette night. And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions- Why are you all dressed up? I'm sick of this house, and I'm sick of you! Tonight we're going for a drive. Mmm, what's so special about tonight? Nothing! Put on your special suit and get in the car! Yes, Mother. Why are we stopping at my school, Mother? What does it say on that sign? I don't like your tone! [All] Surprise! [Chattering, Laughing] Happy anniversary, Son. Oh, Mother. [Sniffles] You are still the master of deception. I surely am. [Crowd] Ahhh. "So, in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner... enlisted and shipped out to Vietnam, where he rose to become platoon sergeant. " Ralph. Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school. Lisa. "Sergeant Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines." Teacher made me go to Principal Skinner's office when I was dirty. "And he survived to make it back to Springfield... where he became the fine educator we salute tonight." When I grow up, I wanna be a principal or a caterpillar. I love you, Principal Skinner. [Cheering] ♪ [Singing] ♪[Ends] "Tribute to Seymour Skinner." Pull over, driver. Now, I know the school normally serves cake only on Thursdays. And I'm also well aware that today is Friday. Nevertheless, I have a surprise for you. ♪[Drumroll] I hope you all brought forks and plates. Mm-hmm! [Murmuring] [Laughs] [Buzzing] Ooh! What the- An enjoyment buzzer. [Laughing] [Applause, Laughter] Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night... to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. Man: You're not Seymour Skinner. [Murmuring] [Gasps] Skinner! Skinner? I'm Skinner. Seymour? [Sobs] Mother! She's my mother! [Murmuring] Will someone remove that crazy man, please? No. No. He's- He's not crazy. It's true. I'm- [Sighs] I'm... an impostor. That man is the real Seymour Skinner. [Gasping, Murmuring] [Thinking] Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake. Now, let's clear this up. Who exactly are you? Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army. It's true. I was in his platoon. But they said you were killed on that scouting mission. No, just captured. It's kind of a funny story, really. After five years in a secret P.O.W. camp... I was sold to China for slave labor. Since '77, I've been making sneakers at gunpoint... in a sweatshop in Huhan. That's not a funny story. Well, I guess you had to be there. Anyhow, the U.N. shut the factory down last week... and the embassy shipped me home, and here I am. So what's your story, Seymour, if that is your real name? Well, obviously it isn't. My real name is Armin Tamzarian. [Gasping] [Laughing] I'm an orphan from Capitol City, and those who recall my fight... to outlaw teenage rudeness may be shocked to learn... that I, myself, was once a street punk. [Shouts] [Tires Screeching] Yeah. The way I was headed, it was just a matter of time... [Siren Wailing] before I wound up in front of a judge. [Yells] What the- [Siren Stops] They gave me a choice: Jail, the army, or apologizing to the judge and the old lady. Of course, if I'd known there was a war going on, I probably would've apologized. [Men Shouting] [Gunfire] [Groans] Okay, who wants a piece of me? You trying to get yourself killed, Tamzarian? You've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't you have any dreams? My dreams all involve combing my hair. Oh, gosh, son. Everybody's got dreams. I come from a town called Springfield. And my dream is to go back and become principal of the elementary school. Some people might call that a pretty corny dream, uh, Sergeant. Well, there's nothing corny about fresh-faced youngsters skipping to school... scraping knees and spelling bees... and pies cooling softly on the windowsill. [Chuckles] Well, sir, if that's corny, then corn me up. [Skinner Narrating] Sergeant Skinner took me under his wing... and showed me that life was won'th living. I came to think ofhim as the big brother I never had. He made me believe I might have a future after all. Come on! And when they told us he was missing... presumed dead, my future died once again. My life lost all meaning. Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity. I'm trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was. Oh, it's one of those stories. [Clears Throat] Sergeant Skinner meant the world to me. And l-I felt it was my duty to deliver the grim news to his mother. [Clears Throat] Hello. I'm, uh- I'm- Seymour, is that you? [Skinner Narrating] I don't know why I did what I did. I guess I couldn't bear to tell her about her son. What I did was wrong, but... I'd do it again. Yes, Mother, it's me. You look different somehow. But you must be Seymour. Yes. You are Seymour. [Skinner Narrating] As strange as it sounds... deep down, I think she knew I wasrt her son... but the lie made us both happier than the truth ever could have. You can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room. Go! Upstairs, third door on the left. Don't walk on the rugs! Yes, Mother. Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant. She was a lonely old woman. If you must blame someone, blame me. That's pretty much what I was planning to do there, Armin. Well, that's about it. And so, for the past 26 years... I've dedicated myself to living out your dream. I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit... or a lavender shirt, but you did take care of Mom. A dagger! A dagger through my heart! Here, Mother. Let me help you. Get your hands off me! Please, Mom. You too, stranger! I'm your son. I have no son. Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son. No! I have one stranger and one fraud. Take it easy, Mom. I said, back off! You better do as she says. She's quick with a hatpin. Uh, well, hey, I suppose I'll have to find a hotel. I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep on the floor of your office. ♪ [Whistling] Hey, Armin. [Muttering, Clears Throat] Miss Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card. Oh, now, Bart, you know that's wrong. I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different... from you using Sergeant Skinner's name. [Sighs] I guess me punishing you would be somewhat hypocritical. Why don't you just write a 30-word essay on what you've done? Hey, hey, hey. Easy there, you big impostor. [Beeping] So, uh, um, should I sign my original name? Just put an "X," then call yourself whatever the hell you want. Well, now, there's no need for profanity. My name may have changed, but I'm still the same man I was last week. Not to us you're not. I mean, how would you feel... if you suddenly found out Ned Flanders was an impostor? Who's Ned Flanders? My next-door neighbor. Religious guy? Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy. No, I don't! What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger... pretending to be something he's not. Mmm. Oh, I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel. No, don't apologize. It's time I stopped pretending. I've called this assembly to announce my retirement... effective as of the end of this sentence. This sentence I'm speaking... right now. Period. [Gasping, Murmuring] I wrongfully usurped Sergeant Skinner's position... and I suggest you consider him to replace me. Thank you. Well, now, I don't know. Skinner, do you know anything about being a principal? Well, it's been my lifelong ambition. And if a man pretending to be me could do it... well, then, logically, the real me must be far more qualified. Good enough. Armin Tamzariars reign of terror is over. Now let us welcome our new Principal Skinner, Principal Seymour Skinner. Uh, him. [Cheering] Well, before I go, I've got some personal items for you. You belong to the Radio Shack Battery Club. Oh, 10 Canadian dollars. That's a souvenir from your trip to Upstate New York. [Chuckles] You've led quite a life, Tamzarian. It's your life. I just kept it warm for you. Oh, I nearly forgot. Your pocket watch. Mother's picture is still inside. Take good care of her. I'll wind her every day. I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian. They're full of tiny bones, so I want you to be careful. I will, Moth- uh, Mrs. Skinner. [Sighs] Well, I'd better be going. [Sighs] [Knocking] Good evening, Edna. I know we were planning to see a film tonight... but instead, I'm leaving town forever. No, please. I don't care what you've done. You're still a decent, honorable man. Mmm. That's the kind of talk that makes me want to marry you. Oh! But instead, I'm leaving town forever. Good-bye. Mmm. Well, it's time to pick up where I left off- as a no-good street punk. [Engine Starts] Principal Skinner? Up yours, children. [Laughs] Now, to recap our top story in its entirety. "The adaptable citizens of Springfield have opened their hearts... to Principal Seymour Skinner, who"- Not that one. Idiots. [Cheering] Thank you. Thank you. I must say, in many ways... Springfield really beats the old slave-labor camp. [Cheering] I admit Sergeant Skinner seems okay. But Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets... and earned our respect and admiration. He lied about his name. His name doesn't matter. "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." Not if you called 'em stench blossoms. Or crap weeds. I'd sure hate to get a dozen crap weeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy. Not if they were called scum drops. Your new principal would like to say a few words. Remember, you have to respect him. He's a war hero. Ha-ha! Thank you, Chalmers. Where I come from, there's no better way to get acquainted... than by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance together. Why don't you lead us, son? Hey, America- [Spoken Lyrics] America. [Flatulent Sound] [Laughter] Well, that's very concise... but it's an insult to everything I suffered for. Now, take a seat, junior, and listen to someone... who gave their youth in service of their country. Mrs. Krabappel, the pledge, please. You haven't dealt with women for a long time, have you, Sergeant? Are you asking me out? [Siren Wailing] Ah, 433rd Street. My old neighborhood. Hmm. "Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Capitol City's nakedest ladies. They're not even wearing a smile. Nod suggestively. Yes, six. Count 'em. Six gorgeous ladies just dying... for your leers and catcalls. Yowza, yowza." [Clock Chimes] [Groans] Seymour, it's 7:30. Where were you? A bar, Mom. I don't know what that is... but on Fridays, you come straight home after school! Tonight is silhouette night. Sit there. I really just came home to change into a turtleneck. Seymour, sit! In the morning. Oh, Mom, I'm borrowing your car. Good morning, Agnes. Mmm. Mmm, how's your new son working out? That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky, middle-aged man in creation! Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people who wanna bad-mouth Sergeant Skinner? And have 10 items or less. Twelve, 11, 10. The mars a weenie. Oh, now, be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too... but he was at least as big a weenie as Sergeant Skinner. But he was our weenie. Now, there was a weenie... you could be proud to call your son. Did you ever tell him that? Hmm. Okay, once more, where are we going? To Capitol City. And why are you and the old lady in the car? We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back. And why is Marge here? I came up with the idea. And why am I here? Because the streets of Capitol City... are no place for three unescorted ladies. And why are the kids here? Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them. And why is Grampa here? 'Cause Jasper didn't wanna come by himself. [Chuckles] Fair enough. Hello, beautiful! In your dreams. We'll see about that. [Snoring] Hello, beautiful. [Snoring Resumes] My mind is made up. I'm not coming back, and that's final. Oh, Seymour. And I'm not Seymour. My name is Armin. This is Armirs apartment... Armirs liquor, Armirs copy of Swank, Armirs frozen peas. Can I see your copy of Swank, Armin? Yes, you can. This is Armirs life. Maybe it's not perfect, but at least I'm back where I belong. I was born a no-goodnik, and I'll die a no-goodnik. Seymour! I didn't bring you up to use language like that! You didn't bring me up at all. The hell I didn't! I've been taking care of you for 26 years! I'm the only mother you've ever known! But you have your real son. You're my real son! You've been my son longer than he has. He doesn't need me, and I don't need him! You march yourself downstairs and get in that car! Yes, Mother. And the rest of you too! [All] Yes, Mrs. Skinner. [Honking Horn] Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzariars back! And he's gonna take over the school again! [Chattering] Now, hold on. Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps. All right, all right. So he's a fraud. I don't care. His mom doesn't care. Do any of you care? Nope, not me. I guess not. You all seem to be forgetting that I am Seymour Skinner. This is where I belong. You can't ask me to disappear because you like some other guy better. I gave half my life for you people. Arert I entitled to a little dignity? You're, uh- You're right, Sergeant. Well, I don't see any way out of this. Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution... that'll satisfy the town and let Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity. [Train Horn Blowing] But I'm a hero! And we salute you for it. Now, don't come back. [Cheering] I'm sorry, Seymour. ♪[Marching Band] It's nice you're alive, but you're just not what I'm looking for in a son. I'm glad you understand. [Cheering Continues] ♪[Continues] Well, this is a lovely gesture, but... we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner. Oh, no, we don't. Judge Snyder. By authority of the city of Springfield... I hereby confer upon you the name of Seymour Skinner... as well as his past, present, future and mother. Okay. And I further decree... that everything will be just like it was... before all this happened. And no one will ever mention it again... under penalty of torture. [Cheering] Here, Son. This is yours again. Mmm. I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner... but these last few days as that hotheaded rogue Armin Tamzarian... have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too uptight in the past. Well, from now on, you're gonna see a new Seymour Skinner. Oh, no, we won't! Yes, Mother.

You don't remember how you got it? Nuh-uh. Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, The Artist Formerly Known as Prince was currently known as Prince.

We've already gone way past our life expectancy. But think of the children! I heard that witches come to your house... and take your children away to eat them! Hmm. Eat their children. Geez, we were just gonna swipe their shoes. But a good idea is a good idea. [All Cackling] [Ned] Who is it? [All] Witches! [Maude] Um, what do ya want? We're here to eat your kids. [Ned] Okay, come on in... and look at this! Oh, please. Now make with the kids. Don't blame yourself, Daddy. You did everything you could. [Whimpers] Maude, do something. Oh. Uh, excuse me. Are you sure you ladies wouldn't prefer some gingerbread children instead? They're boneless. [All] Hmm? [All] Mmm. Children: Ow! [Hooting] Bye, witches. Thanks for not eating me. Yeah, you hags are all right. What did you get? A candied apple. I got a caramel cod. You know, scaring people into giving us treats is fun. We should do this every year. I just wish we hadrt filled up on all those kids before we got to the Flanders'. [Belches] [All Cackling] Yargh. And that's the story of the very first caramel cod. I mean, Halloween. And it wasrt long... before this yearly custom became an annual tradition. [Children Chattering] Come on! Give us some candy! Don't pretend you're not home. Dad, that's our house. [Crowd Laughing] She's a witch! Man: Get her! [Crowd Shouting] [Lisa Screaming] [Woman Screaming]
#09x05 - The Cartridge Family^[Male Announcer] The Continental Soccer Association... is coming to Springfield! It's all here- fast kickir, low scorir. And ties? You bet! [Women Gasping, Giggling] Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game? I don't know. Announcer: You'll see all your favorite soccer stars... like Ariaga, Ariaga II... Bariaga, Aruglia, and Pizzoza! Oh, I never heard of those people. And they'll all be signing autographs! Whoo-hoo! This match will determine once and for all... which nation is the greatest on Earth- Mexico or Portugal! [Together] Can we go, Dad? Please, Dad? Please, Dad? Can we go? Huh? Huh? Please? Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes! Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win. It's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp. Yo, paella man, wing one up here! Hey, look, it's Pelé! ♪[Fanfare] [Cheering] Pelé is king of the soccer field. To be king of your kitchen, use Crestfield Wax Paper. [Cheering] ♪[Fanfare] [Whistle Blowing] [Cheering, Shouting] Man: Kick it over here! [Cheering, Shouting Fades] Boring! Come on, you schnorrers! Do something! Halfback passes to the center. Back to the wing. Back to the center. Center holds it. Holds it. Holds it. [Sighs] Halfback passes to center! Back to wing! Back to center! Center holds it! Holds it! Holds it! I can't bear this any longer. I'm leaving! Yeah, not before me you ain't. Now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone. Oh, that's it. You're dead, pal! Hey, now, that's uncalled for. Shut your hole, Skinner! [Gasping, Shouting] [Yelling] You call this a soccer riot? Come on, boys. Let's take 'em to school! Oi! Oi! Oi! Homer, we've got to get out of here! Oh! But I wanna do some rioting. [Grunts] Jobbers cobknots, ya mucker! All done. [Gasping] [Siren Wailing] What began as a traditional soccer riot... has escalated into a citywide orgy of destruction. Reacting swiftly, Mayor Quimby has declared mob rule. So for the next several years, it's every family for itself! Ex-Ex-Excuse me, sir. I think you've got my TV. Sir? Somebody's gotta stop them! Let's wait until they burn the school down. Oh, my God! Homer, they're right next door. Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know. [Rattling] [Gasps] Watch the fish, Marge. [Groans] Looks like you called me just in time. This home isn't secure at all. What did I tell you, Marge? Intruders could come in down the chimney, through the mail slot... even hidden in your groceries. Did you change the locks when you moved in? I thought not. All the previous owners of this house could still be in here somewhere. What do you recommend? Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good... but doesn't provide any real protection. Oh, let's get that! But if you really wanna sleep easy at night... I recommend sealing off every door and window with bulletproof Lucite. Wouldrt we all suffocate? Well, I should hope not. Let's get that, the suffocation thing. And you can have it all for just $500. $500? Aw, forget it. But surely you can't put a price on your family's lives. I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are. Homer, we need something to protect this family. I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind... and peace of mind is what you shall have. I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please. Aisle 6, next to the sympathy cards. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm! Whoa! Careful there, Annie Oakley. I don't have to be careful. I got a gun. Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit. Holster. Oh, yeah. Bandolier. Baby. Silencer. Mm-hmm. Loudener. Oh! Speed-cocker. Ooh! I like the sound of that. And this is for shooting down police helicopters. Oh, I don't need anything like that... yet. Just give me my gun. Sorry. The law requires a five-day waiting period. We've got to run a background check. Five days? But I'm mad now! [Grunts] I'd kill you if I had my gun! Yeah, well, you don't. Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns. If he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two. What happens when he walks into my store? Then we'll see who's worried about five-day waiting periods. Dad, it's 3:00 a.m.! Can't you mutter in your room? Marge kicked me out. [Groans] All right. Go ahead. Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you, parents these days, they don't know how to rear children. Oh! How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something? ♪[Rock] [Quacking] ♪[Ends] [Gasping] Come on! Come on! Open up! [Panting] Ah, that's the stuff. [Toilet Flushing] Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me. Well, let's see here. According to your background check, you've been in a mental institution. Yeah. Frequent problems with alcohol. [Chuckling] Yeah. You beat up President Bush. Former president. "Potentially dangerous"? Relax. That just limits you to three handguns or less. Whoo-hoo! Close your eyes, Marge. I've got a surprise for you. Mmm! Okay, open your eyes. [Screams] It's a handgun. Isn't it great? This is the trigger, and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die. Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns? I thought Smithers did it. That would have made a lot more sense. Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I wanna scare that old security guard at the bank. Only if you clean your room. [Groans] No! No one's using this gun. [Whimpering] The TV said you're 58% more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder. TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution. Dad, the Second Amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. It has no meaning today. You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the king of England... could just walk in here anytime he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you? No. All right, then. I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons. A gun is not a weapon, Marge! It's a tool, like a butcher knife or a harpoon... or, uh, an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what. You come with me to an N.R.A. meeting... and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more. [Beeping] [Beeping Stops] [Beeps] Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately... but they're manufactured for a reason- to take out today's modern super animals... such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel. Learning something, Marge? [Groans] Uh, hi. I'm Moe S. [All] Hi, Moe! Yeah, so last night, I was closing up the bar... when some young punk comes in and tries to stick me up. [All Gasping] Whatever did you do, Moe? Well, it could've been a real ugly situation... but I managed to shoot him in the spine. [Applause] Yeah, I guess the next place he robs better have a ramp. [Laughter] Hi. I'm Homer S. [All] Hi, Homer! Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar... it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become... a lifetime member of your wonderful organization. [Cheering, Shouting] Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts. Oh, come on. Be fair, Marge. For once in your life, be fair! [Groans] [Explosion] Sorry! My fault. ♪ [Whistling] [Gasps] Don't shoot. Just take the money and get out. What? Oh, Apu, I would never- Or would I? [Thinking] I've already gone this far. I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart. I'll do it. I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart. All right, put your- D'oh! Oh, well, I'll rob it next time. Can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad? Sure thing, honey. You want me to get the cat down? No, thanks. Rull! Missed one, Dad. See you in hell, dinner plate. [Gunshot] Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went? Um- You probably left 'em at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next N.R.A. get-together? Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table. You said the breakfast table. It's the same table! Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on. Whoops! Guess it was already on. Uh, I'd better just put it down. No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool. Homer, I think you'd agree that I've put up with a lot in this marriage. But this is the first time since we've been married... that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children... please, please get rid of the gun. All right, Marge. I'll do it for you. [Moaning] I'm a lucky woman. And I'm a wonderful man. [Straining] Aw! I don't feel them. You said there'd be "Fudgeicles," Bart. Where's the "Fudgeicles"? First, it's Fudgsicle. And I know they're up here. I just need a better foothold. Hello! And the next marksman is William Tell, Jr.! Jinx! [Gasps] Bart! Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun. You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun. I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper? How could you? Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable! But, Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out! [Groans] Until you decide what's more important... your gun or your family... we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids. So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine! Do you know how to cook dinner? Do I? I've left Homer. Thank God. So we need a place to spend the night. Try the Sleep-Eazy Motel. I woke up there once. Seemed nice. Why can't we stay here? Uh, we have a gentleman caller. Hey, this TV's not broken. It's just unplugged. What the- Ooh, the gun club's gonna be here any minute. [Doorbell Rings] [Gasps] They're here! They're here! Hiya, Homer. I brung ya a big bag of irregular Oreos. I don't see what's wrong with this one. Oh. Lookir for a good time, sailor? I certainly am. No, you're not! He's really not. And that's how, with a few minor adjustments... you can turn a regular gun into five guns. [Light Applause] Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies. Anyone else want a beer? Homer, you use your gun as a can opener? I use it for everything. Watch me turn on the TV. [Gunfire] [Grunting] I've never seen such recklessness! You might've hurt someone! Are you some kind of moron? Yeah, but- Hey, yutz. Guns aren't toys. They're for family protection, hunting dangerous or delicious animals... and keeping the king of England out of your face. Your membership card please, Homer. Oh! I'll also need to remove your tattoo. I didn't get one yet. Rats. Now, since you're no longer a member... please go outside until the meeting is over. [Chuckling] ♪[Disco] [Laughing, Chattering] Hey, we got a pool! Can we go swimming, Mom? Mmm, not right now, dear. Wow! The TV's coin-operated. And so is the Bible! I'd like to order a wake-up call, please. 3:00 a.m. Uh, for every room except this one. That's right. Good night. [Chuckling] Always love trying out new material on the road. Bart: No way are you gonna beat me this time, Lise. [Coins Clinking] [Voice Wavering] Yes, I am! Come on, Spotty! Come on, Smelly! [Gunfire] Oh! This gun cost me everything- my wife, my kids. Everything but my precious, precious gun. [Gunshot] This stinks. I want my family back. Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling? [Male Voice] No. Go back to sleep. This bed is making me nauseous! Why won't it stop? Honey, it'll be morning soon. Try to get some sleep. [Door Opens] [Gasps] Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Are you planning to stay the whole night? Yes! All right. Vote Quimby. Marge? [Man Groans] Sorry. Marge? [Woman Gasps] Oh. Sorry. Marge? [Mayor Quimby] Vote Quimby. Sorry. Marge: Down here, Homer! Oh, Marge, there's so many things I wanna yell to you! Come down here! Okay! Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome... and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks. What about the gun? It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection... if you've got no one to protect? Oh, Homie. Mmm! Come on, kids. We're goir home. [Together] Yea! Okeydoke. Here's your bill... and your continental breakfast. [Coughing] All right, everybody, hands up! You, give me the cash drawer. Do what he says. I'm too rich to die. Freeze, bad guy! Vote Quimby! Okay, man. Don't shoot. Chill. Homer, you said you got rid of the gun! You lied to me again! I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was- Yoink! [Sinister Laughter] The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing. [Rattling] [Laughing] Yo, give me the bullets. Okay. Don't shoot! [All] Drop it! Bye! How did you know we were being robbed? The clerk here pressed the silent alarm, and we picked it up on our scanner. Did anyone stop that robber? No, I don't think so. I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge... but this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power... like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again. Hmm!
#09x06 - Bart Star^Well, your cholesterol level is lethally high, Homer... but I'm more concerned about your gravy level. Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day. [Laughing] Well, you're a little confused. Oh, confused, would we? Okay, gentlemen, I want you to raise your hand when you hear the tone. You can't tell me what to do. [Tone] [Higher-pitched Tone] Nothing yet. [Very High-pitched Tone] [Both Screaming] Now, make no mistake. When I say "first aid"... I'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert. [Laughing] I'm talking about treating serious injuries. [All Laughing] [Chuckles] Serious injuries. Oh, that's gold. Mom, Mom. I stepped in a bear trap. Sounds like you need some... first aid. Oh, wow! Oh, bravo! All right. [Grunting] Come on! You can't do one sit up? I loved your last McBain movie, Mr. Wolfcastle. Quit stalling, fatty. [Inales] We can wait. [Exhales] Come to papa. [Grunting] Come on! Even my fat mama can touch her toes. [Rips] Hey, Bart, we wear the same underpants. Results from yesterday's health fair are in and the news is not good. Springfield is in terrible shape... particularly our young boys. [Grunting] [All Laughing] Hey, tubby, want another Pop-Tart, tubby? I'm comfortable with who I am. You're a disgrace to this family. In this reporter's opinion, it's time for our lard-laden lads to shape up. Get out and try fun activities like military service... frenetic dancing or good old-fashioned peewee football. There you go, Bart. Peewee football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches. Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt. Then it's settled. We don't have to play football, do we, Daddy? [Chuckles] Oh, you betcha. Team sports will keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls. [Both] Yea! You know, Milhouse, you are getting a little doughy. Ah, can't I just have the surgery? He's gonna need, uh, you know, protection. Sure. One helmet coming up. I was thinking more like protection for... down there. Oh. Why didn't you say so? Knee pads. You got it. [Nervous Laughter] I'm talking about his- [Whispering] personal area. Aha. Say no more. I read you loud and clear. The old shoulder pads. Look, I want a cup. Cup. Could you spell that? C-U-P. I wanna C-U- Oh, my God! [Groans] Okay, Milhouse, let's try out the new cup. [Grunts] [Chuckles] Again. [Grunts] [Yawns] [Grunting] Marge: Mllhouse, stop that!

You do? Uh-huh. But we'd love to have you on board. Well, football's not really my thing. After all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig? Well, actually, Lisa, these balls are synthetic. And for every ball we buy, a dollar goes to Amnesty lnternational. I've got to go. Who are we? [All] The Wildcats! Who are we gonna beat?

Yeah, well, he's... wearing that hat like an idiot. You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize. Fun too. All right, Wildcats, are you ready to give 110%, take it one game at a time... and go the whole nine yards? [Together] Yeah! Nine yards! Okilly-dokilly! Let's put on our game faces. Got it! Go! Give me the ball and your lunch money. I love this game. [Whistle Blows] [Crowd Cheerlng] Ooh, he's quite a little dancer. Ah, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat! Yeah.

Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax? Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? [Line Clicks] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Homer again. I think we got cut off.

It sounds like you just volunteered. Me? But you were doing such a great job. [Groaning] [Screaming] You're not gonna make the team with that kind of attitude. I don't want to make the team.

I don't like the sound of that. I'm scared, Daddy. Too scared to even wet my pants. It's okay, Son. Just relax, and it'll come. Even Lisa Simpson must now agree. We have witnessed a miracle. Hardly. Anyone could've written that. Oh, angel, listen not to this child of Satan. Reverend, I've got to admit. This doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated. Oh, now, be calm, Ned. But be afraid also- tremendously afraid- for the day of reckoning is upon us! [Gasping, Murmuring] Reckoning? Your Holiness, there is word from America. They say an angel has foretold the apocalypse. Um, keep an eye on it. [Mrs. Krabappel] This could be our last day together, my love. How about a farewell romp in the Garden of Earthly Delights? Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup, you read my mind. Just, uh, give me 20 minutes or so to finish these tardy slips. Why we gettir dressed-up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus? Well, you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe. So we're not going to Black Angus. Will you leave me alone? It's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid Judgment Day. Please, Lisa. I don't know exactly what's gonna happen. But I really wish we could make peace before sunset. Nothing is going to happen, Mom! I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end. Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, "Nearer, My God, to Thee" maybe? Or-Or-Or-Or "Amazing Grace"? Mmm. Nah. Oh, Marge. Don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they got to take me too. Ten seconds till sundown. [Murmuring] [Taking Deep Drag] [Huffing Exhale] We did it. We beat cancer.

Oh, yeah. Out of my way, shorty! Hey! [All Clamoring] I don't understand, Professor. Why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake? I'm gonna be honest with you, Lisa. I never did the tests.

Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired. [Groans] Is this all we're going to do today? Absolutely. [Choking, Relieved Sigh] [Choking, Relieved Sigh] You know, Homer, I'm starting to realize life is short. It is? We have to make the most of the time we have. We do? Otherwise, we could wake up one day... and realize we've wasted our whole lives. Oh, that. [Laughing] [Choking, Relieved Sigh] Oh! Friends of the Library is holding an historic manuscript viewing. "Friends of the Library"? Ooh! Ooh! There's an azalea festival at the public garden. I went yesterday. [Groans] Lenny really wanted to go. I'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time. Open a window. [Groans] All right. I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppir out. The police auction? Can you believe it? It's already been a year. Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams! I don't want a drug boat. Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners too. All right. Listen up. Listen up. These prestigious wrought iron security gates are bulletproof... bombproof and battering ram resistant. Now- Then what happened to Johnny D.? He forgot to lock 'em. Now, what am I bid? One kilo. Sold. Ay, ay, ay, my gates. Ay! Johnny C. gave me those. Tough break, amigo. [Laughing] Next item up for bids. Oh, no! Oh, hey, look, they're sellir your car, man. Boy, it's nice. Oh, I will totally kill whoever buys I'il Bandit. Sold! Whoo-hoo! [Imitating Engine Revving] You bought a car without consulting me? I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat. I found this hat. Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm, mm, mm. [Tires Screeching] [Marge Screams] Homer, be careful. Oh, yeah, you gotta be careful when you do a trick like this. [Tires Screeching] Stop, Homer! Stop it! Let me out! You're the boss. I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person. [Tires Screeching] Okay. Bye. Love ya. You know, if you lived here, you'd be home by now. Mr. Hutz, I didn't know you sold real estate. You didn't? We should talk more often, Marge. You see, the law business is a little slow... and since most of my clients wind up losing their houses... this was a natural move for me. Helping people find homes. That must be really rewarding. Yes, the money is good. But the beauty is you get to stay in the house until it's sold. Come on, guys. Let's go for a swim. [Dogs Barking] Gee, this hotrod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gearhead, Homer. Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert. What is that, a six-barrel Holley carb? You betcha. Edelbrock intakes? Nothir but. Myohoff lifters? Oh, yeah. I made that last one up. I see. Selling real estate could be just what I'm looking for. I'd really like to give it a try. I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step towards failure. [Groans] Oh, boy. I've got a lot to learn before that license test. Don't worry, Mom. We'll help you study. Of course, we'll have to cut back on our own homework. What in the heck is a dwelling? So, you're married, and you're looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs. - Superman. Oh! Don't listen to my husband. He's just an idiot. I'm a veterinarian, and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted? Not in my damn house.

What about me? You didn't thank me. You didn't do anything. I like being thanked. [Bells Jingle] Welcome to the big leagues, Marge. There's over 50 years of real estate experience right in this room. And 42 of those years are Gill's! Marge, it's a real pleasure. You got any leads? I need some leads. Please, help me. That's enough, Gill. Don't drag her down with you. That's Cookie Kwan. She's number one on the west side. Hi, Marge! Stay off the west side. And there's Nick Callahan. Marge: A headset telephone? I thought those only existed in the movies. [Clanging] Boo-yah! Guess who sold the Whitman place? Good for you. Way to go. I had been working on the Whitman place for 21 years. And now, Marge, I'd like to welcome you to the family... with your very own red blazer. [Gasps] For me? Oh, ho, ho! Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I'm going to do my darnedest to uphold the principles... and ideals this jacket represents. I give her a week. Are you guys talking about the west side? No, Cookie. I swear it. I'm scared of you. [Tires Screeching] Whoa, Dad, doesn't this car have seat belts? Seat belts. [Scoffs] They kill more people than they save. That's not true. You're thinking of air bags. There it is! [Both] Wow! Your own billboard! Check it out! Homer: Gee, that picture makes your butt look big. I thought so too, but they said it sells. Works for the Lumber King. Lumber. We need lumber. Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak. Have you ever considered selling your home? What? No. Why? What? Why? What have you heard? Are you implying I'm in some sort of financial trouble? No. Well, I am. Let me have that card. And here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen- "with gas range, central can opener... and foam under flooring for enanced standability." Why, isn't this kitchen horribly cramped? [Laughing] Why, yes, it is. Well, I suppose we could get used to it. Yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. You know, I've always loved the house you're in now. Really? Well, maybe we should stay put. Thanks for your honesty, Marge. My pleasure. If you ever need a prescription, no questions asked- [Clicks Tongue, Laughing] Good shot, Barbara. I can't believe it. A house with a bowling alley. Do you bowl often? Actually, this is our first time. And I didn't really care for it. Oh, well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you? I suppose not. I guess we were just captivated by this delightful plaque. [Laughing] [Tires Screech, Engine Revving] Hey, Skinner, wanna drag race? My high school sweetheart was killed in a drag racing accident. Come on. It'll be fun. That's what Debbie Sue said. Come on, you stupid car. [Engine Grinding] Just-Just go! [Grinding Continues] No!

[Tires Screeching] [Coughing, Sniffing] Hey, that smells like regular. She needs premium, dude! Premium, dude! Marge, I had a lot of calls about you. Customers love your no-pressure approach. Well, like we say, "The right house for the right person." Listen, it's time I let you in on a little secret, Marge. The right house is the house that's for sale. The right person is anyone. But all I did was tell the truth. Of course you did. But there's the truth... and the truth! Let me show you. It's awfully small. I'd say it's awfully cozy. Marge: That's dilapidated. Rustic. That house is on fire. Motivated seller. That's a beauty! Forget about that house. That's the Murder House. Ooh, I remember. Mrs. Astor was very lucky. Well, no one expects you to sell that house. But you'd better sell something. Because cubicles are for closers, Marge. Anybody who doesn't sell a house their first week gets fired. I probably should've mentioned that earlier. I thought I'd do anything to succeed in business. But bending the truth? I don't know. Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal. Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world... you're still the world's greatest wife and mother. [Scoffs] So that's how you see me? As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world? [All] Mm-hmm. Well, I can too compete. And I'm going to sell a house. End of story. Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace? [Groans] The first house I have to show you is, um... a handymars dream. Mm-hmm. Because it's so dilapidated. [Groans] Well, nothing's perfect. I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house. Now, slow down, Neddie. The home buyer's course... said always look inside the house before buying. Well, there it is. Please don't tell anyone how I live. Hmm. It's awfully small. Some people would call it cozy. I guess it is sorta cute. But small. Really, really small. Hmm. Wh-When you put it that way, it does seem a bit small. [Groans] Well, that about does it for houses in this area. Wait. What about that house? That has a "for sale" sign. Ooh, that's a dilly. How about it, Marge? Uh- Oh, my-diddley-eye! Will you look at this place! [Gasps] And the price has been slashed repeatedly. It's sure built solid. The kids could scream bloody murder, and no one would hear. I'm just gonna spill my guts. I love it to death. I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute. Unless you can give me a reason not to. Is there anything else we should know? There's the truth, and the truth! No! No! If you don't sell a house, you're fired, fired, fired. [Screaming] Well, Marge? No. There is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house. That's good enough for me! [Screams] Purple drapes! All my life I've wanted purple drapes! [Screams] [Clanging] Attention. Ding-ding, ding-ding, ding-ding. Listen up, everybody. Marge Simpson sold her first house. How about that? The Murder House! Wow, now, that's something! Boo-yah! Wow, you must've told a whopper to unload that death trap. What'd you use, Marge? The old buff and bluff? The Hail Murray? The Susquehanna Shuffle? Huh? [Clicks Tongue] Huh? [Clicks Tongue] Huh? [Laughing] No. No. No tricks. It was salesmanship. That's all. Sure, Marge. "Salesmanship." But it was. Sure, Marge. "Was." Just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits... doesn't mean the Flanders will be. I guess you're right. Who cares? Whatever happens, as our newest closer... you're entitled to wear the coveted closing blazer. [Applause] And you get a third wall for your cubicle. But I earned that wall. Don't push your luck, pal. You're hangir on by a thread. Well, I brought this wall from home. [Tires Screeching] [Laughs] Okay. Baldy boy hits wire, head comes off... I'il Bandit rolls to a gentle stop. Everybody wins.

What's for dinner? Well, neighboreenos, I guess this is good-bye. Oh, I better make this quick, or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby. Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help. Now that you mention it, we could use- It was just an expression. [Groans] Good-bye, Ned. If the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, call me right away. Or you can beep me. In fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? We'll go to a hotel. Oh, you're sweet to offer... but we're all just so tired... we just wanna get to our new house and rest in peace.

There's nothing like that in there. You see, when I get bored I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span. But our point is very simple. You see, when- Oh, look! A bird! [Chirping] [Giggling] The circle of judgment never fails to destroy their self-esteem. Then he'll be ours to mold. Let the judgment begin. I'll get the ball rolling. You're a fat idiot. Yeah! Lose some weight! Hey, man. You're fat. Fatso. Moron. [All Chattering] [Otto] Fat too. Well, yeah. I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes. [Chuckles] You've failed at everything you've ever tried. Whoa. You've got my number on that one, buddy. This is a smart group. And your stink brings tears to my eyes. Now wait a minute, Moe. [Sniffs] Oh. My mistake. [Both Sigh] Why isn't our low-protein gruel wearing down his resistance like all the others? It doesn't wear down your resistance if you eat a month's supply. He even ate mine. [Groaning] You gonna finish that, bony? Oh, "griven"- Let's try the chant. Everyone loves a droning, repetitive chant. Attention, everyone. Let's all give thanks to the Leader for this glorious day. [Chanting] The Leader is good. The Leader is great. We surrender our will as of this date. The Leader is good. The Leader is great. We surrender our will as of this date. It's no use. He's obviously the most powerful mind we've ever dealt with. Or- ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Singing] ♪ [Continues] ♪ [Singing] I mean- ♪ [Sings] I love the Leader. Marge: You what? Come again, Marge? You what? I've joined the Movementarians. And so have all of you. Marge: We what? All I had to give them... was our life savings, the deed to the house... and a commitment of 10 trillion years of labor. I can't go along with this, Homer. Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family. Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed? I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl. Homer! What? What did I say? Church, cult. Cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday. Does this really change our day-to-day lives? Of course not- except that we're all moving to the Movementarian agricultural compound... to be near the Leader and serve him. I'm not leaving my home. [Door Opens] [Chuckles] Oh, yes, you are. I'm afraid it's our home now. This house will become the new local welcome center for this district. And it didn't cost us a dime. Springfield has been overrun by a strange and almost certainly evil sect... calling themselves "the Movementarians." In exchange for your home and all your money... the leader of this way-out and wrong religion... claims he'll take believers away on his spaceship to the planet Blisstonia. Excuse my editorial laugh. [Laughs] But- Ladies and gentlemen, I've just learned of a change in this statiors management. Welcome, Movementarians. Continue to improve our lives. I love you, perfect Leader, and new C.E.O. of KBBL Broadcasting. I love you, perfect Leader, and new C.E.O. of KBBL Broadcasting. Homer Simpson, your family will be housed here... for the first 100,000 years. Then something might open up in a double. [Chuckles] Why even unpack? [Groans] Dad and all these other people... are obviously the products of mental conditioning. Yeah. Maybe it'll wear off, like his interest in C.B. radio. That's a negatory, good buddy! I kind of think it's cool. Just pretend you're in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place... for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc. These rubes in robes haven't met the likes of Bart Simpson before. [Cackles] I love the Leader. Of course you do. This so-called "new religion"... is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants... designed to take away the money of fools. Let us say the Lord's Prayer 40 times, but first let's pass the collection plate. [Chuckles Nervously] Looks like slim pickings today, Reverend. Oh, Lord. Uh, try the emergency plate, Ned. I don't think that's gonna do it. Um- See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now. You two, stop talking and resume the lima bean harvest. When we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over. [All Murmuring] Man: What's going on? Whoa. What's goir on? Look! The forbidden barn opens. [All Gasping] Woman: He's coming! [All Chattering] Oh, boy. We get to see the Leader pass by. We toil in the fields, and he rides around in a Rolls-Royce? Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are you gonna do? I'm covered in the dust of the Leader. He favors me! I am even dustier. Dustier than thou! Oh, look who the new pet is. I've never been so happy. Smithers, why haven't I heard of this "the Leader"? He's as rich and wicked as I, but he seems to enjoy tax-exempt status. [Chuckles] Actually, sir, with our creative bookkeeping... and corporate loopholes, we only pay three dollars a year. [Gasps] You're right. We're getting screwed. There must be something I can do about this. Wait. Yes. I think I know just the thing. [Cackling] Uh, sir? You have to tell me what your plan is, or- or nothing will happen. Oh, yes. Of course. The plan. You see me as a god, right, Smithers? Absolutely, sir. You'd kneel before me. Boy, would I! Yes. Uh, then I'll form my own religion with its own symbol. We'll use this special "K." I believe that's already a breakfast cereal, sir. And people worship it? In a way. All right then. Uh, how about this? Uh, why don't you leave the symbol to me, sir? Ladies and gentlemen, behold your new god... Mr. Burns. [All Gasp] Ahoy-hoy, lowly mortals. In addition to working for me, you may now praise me as your Almighty. Amen, sir. Mmm! [Groaning] [Screams] Uh, we'll try this again tomorrow. Ah, he's all right. But he's no bowl of Special "K." This is ridiculous. We're already married. But, Marge, we're not mass married. At least you got to choose your mate. We got matched up on the printout. Hey. Remember our agreement. I'm the man. You're the man! I could have done a lot worse, Mother. Speak for yourself. So, do you enjoy comic books? And who can tell me where thunder and lightning come from? Yes, Bart? The Leader, ma'am. Very good, Bart. And who invented Morse code? Oh. I should know this one. The-The Leader? Ah. Correct again. He's wrong! You're wrong! The whole damn system is wrong! [Screams] What's the matter, Lisa? You used to be such a good student. Don't you want to please your teachers and get good grades? [Sighs] Grades? ♪[Singing] ♪ [Ends] These lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. Oh! A lima bean that looks just like the Leader! I'll put it with the others. Homer... you know I always try to put the best face on everything... but there's no face on that damn bean! We hate it here! And your family wants to leave. [Bart & Lisa] No, we don't, Mother. We love the Leader. No! All righty. Time for bed. I'm leaving this place, and you'd better step aside. Lady, people are free to go whenever they wish. [Growling] [Barking] Hi-yah! [Barking] [Screaming] Oh. I never thought I'd have to do this again. [Panting] Reverend Lovejoy! [Coughs] You've gotta help me. My entire family has been taken in by the evil Movementarians. Oh, I feel for you, my child, and I'd like to help you. [Clears Throat] [Groans] [Clinks] Now, how are we going to get my Homie back? [Scraping] I'll kidnap him for 50... deprogram him for 100, and I'll kill him for 500. No, no, no. Just the first two. All right. I'll throw in the killir for free. [Vehicle Approaching] [Together] Yea! Here comes the Leader! What an honor. We've been called into the presence of- Marge? You're the Leader? You don't look anything like the beans. Knock him out, Reverend! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh, the devil has given him superhuman strength. Give me that, you noodle-armed choir boy! Ow! Well, that didn't do it, Mr. Kilt. Look. Let's the three of us try it together. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ooh! Why? Oh, you're gonna break like matchsticks. I promise you that! Hey. I made some Rice Krispie squares for our hungry deprogrammerinos. Aw, man! You ruined the atmosphere, ya daft pansy! Well, this is my rumpus room. Ach! Don't call it that! Outsiders have kidnapped some of our property. We must respond with our deadliest weapon. The lawyers. [Bell Ringing] Go! Go! Go! [Chattering] [Siren Wailing] Attention, all citizens. Even though the Leader himself is completely nonviolent- [Sirens Wailing] he urges you to be as violent as you like in capturing the Simpsons. [Sirens Stop] [Tires Screech][/i] [Chattering] What are you doing? They're not here, you idiots! Idiots? That's slander, sir, and we have it on tape. All right. I'll get out my checkbook. [Grumbles] What was that? Ah, I said- [Grumbles] So, you kids really love the Leader, huh? Even more than your parents? Yeah. No contest. Of course. Absolutely. All right already. But do you love the Leader... more than having your very own brand-new hover bikes? [Humming] [Both Gasp] What do you have to say about the Leader now, huh? Huh? What Leader? The hell with him. He can taking a flying leap. And who do you love now? [Together] Hover bikes! [Groans] Close enough. [Both] Yea! [All Groan] [Laughs] Sorry, kids. There's no such thing as hover bikes. They're just a couple of Huffys on a fishing line. But we heard them hovering. Oh, I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade. [Humming] Well, can we at least keep the bikes? Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no. They're due back at the store by 6:00. Get off'em. Get off. Off. Get off. All right. Now, what's so all-fire great about your fancy-pants Leader? The Leader knows all and sees all. Ooh. Well, that is impressive. And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet. Oh, this Leader- He sounds like a grand fella. Willie, I'm not sure we're making any headway here. Would you shut up, woman. He's talking about my leader. Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer? Beer? [Salivating] Would you like a tall, frosty one, Homer? [Thinking] No. Must resist temptation. [Thinking] Go ahead. Give in. Beer! Beer! [Thinking] Ooh. These cotton-poly blends are so comfortable. Go on, Homer. Our commandments clearly state that beer is all right. Try some. [Chattering] This man is coming with us. Homer, you don't have to go with them. But I want to go. Well, I would say the matter is settled. You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer... but I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head. Homer, come back! That's my husband! He's our husband now. [All] Yea! I'm glad I'm back... because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue... I was born again! [Both Gasp] Hallelujah! Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn... is because there is no intergalactic spaceship. He's taken our money just so he can... build one hell of a spaceship! [All Gasping] [Leader On Speaker] Homer Simpson... because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation. Whoops. Nice goir there, Homer. Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was telling the truth about everything. Oh, mercy. He's the real deal! [Humming] [All Groan] Come back. Come back! Willie still loves ya, O Great One! Stranger, you're a-trespassir on my dirt farm. Uh, do you happen to need a messiah? No, but I'll take them sacks of money from ya. [Groans] I should have stayed with the Promise Keepers. Damn it! It fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in. Oh, I guess it's back to good old-fashioned voodoo. Wow! I need a drink! Come with me. Uh, is that your collar, Reverend? Uh, yes. [Chuckles] How did that get down there? Come back to papa, baby. To think, I turned to a cult for mindless happiness... when I had beer all along. [Clears Throat] And you, Marge, the bringer of beer. It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.

Yeah. Well, you should be! I only stole two sandwiches and a bag of Doritos. Hey. If a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food. Look. He's licking the slime off that rock. That's what he's been eating. Slime! And there's enough slime for all of us. We're saved! All that slime made this boar extra tender. More snout anyone? Mmm! Mmm! How's your dinner, Lise?

Where's my water? Oh, there it is. All right. Hello. I'm a real person. And as a real person, I've made some humorous observations about real life. For example, have you ever noticed how there are two phone books... a white one and a yellow one? [Chuckles] Like, what's the deal with that? One's residential, the other is business. Oh, well, that makes sense. What will they think of next, blue pages? They have those. They're government listings. I see. Uh, what about two-cent stamps? Pizza pie is very hot these days. Can't open pickle jars. No mail on Sunday. Out of paper towels. Oh, oh, oh. What's the deal with cardboard? Boo! All right, let's just move on to Notebook 2. I've really gotta get dinner started.

[Clears Throat] "Smart lads who slip at times away... "From fields where glory will not stay... "Runners whom the race outran... And the name died before the man." Krusty, does this have a point? Yes. I'm quitting show business. I was just trying to go out... with a little class, you jackass. But, Krusty, why now? Why not 20 years ago? 'Cause comedy ain't funny anymore. Instead of time-tested jokes about women drivers and doctor bills... you got some big-chin schlub... reading typos from the Ralookaville Rost. Well, here's a headline for you: Nobody cares. [Laughing] Hey, I washed your hair. These comics today. "Ooh, look at me. I can't set my V.C.R. "I can't open a bag of airline peanuts. I'm a freakir moron." [Laughing] [Laughing] Krusty's gone nuts.

Or, as the ladies like to call me, "Hey, you, behind the bushes." Is this thing on? No. Sorry, Moe. [Feedback On R.A.] And now, without further Apu. I have been zinged and I love it. The last angry clown, the man who spews truth from every orifice... ladies and gentlemen, Krusty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm watchir TV today- Whoo! TV, yeah!

Marge, give me your purse. Here's $42. That's everything I have. Run home and bury it in the yard. I love you, Mom. [Cheering, Clamoring] Wow, they're hanging on his every word. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I hope so. I thought I made myself clear in Boston. [Chuckling] From now on... I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're getting a little fat around the old thighs. Dad! You too, Bart. Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car. You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge. I'm proud of you, Krusty. Oh, sure, I've got material success... my own show, acres of cars, a nice microwave oven. But you're out there on the edge. You're doir it for the sheer thrill. And if I wasrt so afraid of clowns, I'd give you a big hug. Hey, excuse me, Krusty. We've been watching you at Moe's all week. And your credibility is just-Wow. Get to the point, Armani. Well, we think you'd be the perfect spokesman... for our company's new sports utility vehicle, the Canyonero. I guess you Wall Street weasels didn't get the word. Krusty's not for sale.

Are you sure? 'Cause we're prepared to offer you... a free, fully-loaded Canyonero. [Stammering] Oh, well. No! Take your corporate blood wagon and get the hell out. Are you sure? It's free.

[Cheering] Then they followed me home, beggir me to take a test drive. And let me tell you, talk about roomy. The Canyonero combines the smooth handling of a European sports car... with the rugged drivability of a sturdy 4x4. [Murmuring] Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about? I thought you said those guys were creeps. Yeah, but that was before I got to know 'em. And I'm tellir you, the Canyonero is the Cadillac of automobiles. That's Canyonero. [Clamoring] Wait! Where you going? I still got plenty of beefs. Fat-free yogurt. The-The quality of computer p0rn. [Groans] I knew I should've gone on first. I don't get it, Krusty.

I didn't say "zork"? The point is the camera loves him. But that trivializes the whole idea of Kidz Newz. I mean, let's be honest. Bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain.

Now, turning to- I just think our veterans deserve a little recognition. That's what Veterars Day is for, Bart. But is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers? [Nervous Chuckle] They also have Memorial Day. Oh, Lisa. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. The important thing is veterans deserve a day... to honor them. They have two. Well, maybe they should have three. I'm Bart Simpson. Oh, my. Look at all these letters from people... who want to be Bart's people, Bart. I wish they could all be Bart's people, Mom. I truly do.

Did I hear a, uh, briefcase opening? Okay, before I show you... who wants to guess how I got the money? Dealing drugs? Drugs? I'll have to say drugs too. Close, but you're way off. Look at that beautiful garbage. Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it... in this old abandoned mine. That's awful! I almost wish it were drugs. Some of it is. Good God, Homer. You're turning our wonderful little town... into America's trash hole. Marge! lxnay on the ash holetray. But, Dad, you can't cram garbage under Springfield forever. Sure, I can, honey kitten. [Birds Chirping] I don't know how you did it, Homer... but you certainly solved that budget crisis. [Liquid Gurgles] What the hell is that? Uh, nothing. Now, uh, you were saying how great I was. [Liquid Gurgles] [Grunts] What's this? Melon rinds, panty hose... a term paper from Texas Tech? Simpson, do you know anything about- Dear Lord, please take Mr. Bunny up to heaven. [Ground Rumbling] [All Scream] [Rumbling Continues] Hey, Brandine, I think I done busted my stink bone. [Rumbling Continues] [Gasping] [Tires Screeching] [Crowd] Aye. And all those opposed... to horsewhipping Homer Simpson? Nay. And now, all in favor... of reinstating Ray Patterson? Yea! ♪ [Jazz] [Panting] Oh. [Chuckles] Oh, gosh. You know... I'm not much on speeches, but it's so gratifying... to leave you wallowing in the mess you've made. You're screwed. Thank you. Bye. ♪ [Jazz] He's right. He ain't much on speeches. Now, people, we are far from screwed. [Ground Rumbling] Aaah! [Sputtering] [Crowd Gasps] Time for panic has come. We must move forward and turn to the towrs all-purpose contingency plan. You mean Plan "B"? Yes. "B." [Crunching] I can't believe it's come to this. Come to what? Moving the whole town five miles down the road. It's crazy! Yeah, it's something, all right. So we transplant the town. We're just gonna trash the new Springfield too. Yeah, but what are you gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's. [Grunts] Hi, Moe. Moe: Hey, Homer. Do yourself a favor. Don't turn around. [Flies Buzzing] [Squeaking] [Man Screaming] [Man 2] I told you not to turn around. ♪ [Strumming] Look, guys. I got a Springfield spoon for my spoon collection. Oh, here we go. How many spoons have you got now, Adam? Nine. If I didn't have my spoons, I'd go insane. Can I see it? [Gasps] My spoon! Ow! [Spoon Clatters] w*nk*rs.
#09x23 - King of the Hill^Homer: Ooh! [Alarm Beeping] McBain to base. Under attack by Commie Nazis. [Beeping] They won't stop me from delivering these UNICEF pennies. [Grunts] [Grunts] Go, pennies. Help the puny children who need you. Wow. McBain is really buffed up. You could grate cheese on those abs. Yeah. But can he do this? [Sighs] [Shudders] I surrender. Not so fast. That's what I call breakneck speed. [Laughs] Mom, a man just died. [Groans] Anyway, it's time for the church picnic. What? They had a picnic last week. No, they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church. If God didn't want us to eat in church... he would have made gluttony a sin. [All Laughing] [Chuckles] Ah, the joke's on you. We borrowed that jar from your table. So you just shot your own mustard. Aw, nuts. Homer: Ooh. Still plenty of parking. [Children Chattering] Nice to see you, Homer. Yeah. Out of my way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food. [Giggling] Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers? Oh, it's, uh, soaring majestically, sir. You're it. We'll see about that. After him, Smithers. Aaah! You're not it! Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. Rod, ladies pick first. Okay. I choose... Todd. Oh! Oh! Oh! Bart! Bart! Bart! Over here! Over here! Um, I'll take- [Milhouse] Rick me! Rick me! Nelson. Saving the best for last, huh, Bart? Yeah. That must be it. I pick my dad. Do you want to play capture the flag, Daddy? [Chuckles] We- Sports on a Sunday? Hmm. I better check with Reverend- [Lovejoy] Oh, just play the damn game, Ned. Yeah. Well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my dad. [Snoring] [Nelson] Him? Well, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. Come on, Dad. We're playing capture the flag. Sorry, Son. Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad. But Rod picked his dad. It's a matter of family honor. Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so? [Grunting] [Sighs] Oh. It appears... I will have to find a new fortress of solitude. Okay, Dad. They've got our flag guarded pretty good. I agree. Let's surrender. No. Wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants. Hmm. All right. But don't lose 'em. They're my only pair. I got it! I got the flag! [All Shouting] Get him! Get him! He's getting away! [Chuckles] Stupid kids. Pin him! [All Grunting] This isn't the flag. It looks more like- Ew! [Laughs] Suckers. Go, Dad! [Panting] [All Shouting] [Panting, Wheezing] [Shouting Continues] [Milhouse] He's gettir away! [Panting] Come on, Dad. Just a few more feet. Show 'em what you got. [Panting] [Milhouse] Go! Get him! Go! Go! [Milhouse] Tag him! Tag him! Tag him! Quick! Tag him! Time out! Time out! Oh, I don't think he can get up. Let's egg him! [All] Yeah! [All Shouting, Laughing] [Shouting] Ow! Stop it! Hey. He's trying to turn over. [All Shouting] [Whimpering] [Groans] Homer: I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me. Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this? Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee. Yeah. Well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape. Whatever you say, sweetie. No. I mean it. I'm really serious this time. Okay, honey. Okay. I'll start taking in all your slacks. [Laughs] [Grunts] [Panting] Okay, boy. I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way, I won't be embarrassed if I fail. [Barks] [Screeches] Oh, great. Now the cat knows. Okay. Here we go. [Panting] Oh! [Growling] [Inales Deeply] Look, Son. Daddy got in shape. [Exhales Deeply] [Groans] Oh. I've gotta keep trying. Or I could just move that picture. No. The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside. [Growling] [Panting] [Groans] D'oh! Hey! [Groans] D'oh! [Groans] [Bell Dings] [Panting] [Snoring] Hmm? [Clears Throat] So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies? Uh, don't you have anything healthy here? Oh, well, we do have some low-salt candy bars... and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free. Hey. These Powersauce bars look pretty healthy. Oh, yes. That is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce. Hmm. "A bushel of apples packed in each bar... "plus the secret ingredient that unleashes... the awesome power of apples." Wow! [Mispronouncing] "Gym"? What's a "gym"? [Mispronounces] Oh. A "gym." Ow. Ow. Boy, I'm feeling this. Ow. Ooh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. [Grunts] Excuse me. You're doing this station all backwards. Let me show you how to do it like a man. [Gasps] Rainier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies... and your Powersauce bars and your taught, rippling- Hey, hey, hey. That's enough. Now step over to the Abdominator... and I will shout slogans at you. [Grunting] Push. Harder. Go past the max. Reach over the top. Master your ass. [Crackling] [Grunting] Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word dumbbell meant. This place is great. Mm-hmm. Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh! Well, I'm flattered but spoken for. Oh, what the heck. Give me your number. Dad, what have you done to your stomach? And your chest. And your shirt! I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now! Oh, my goodness gracious! [Chuckles] Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on! No. Not there. Not there either. Over here. I've got some. No. Here. Try my foot. No. Not that foot. Just feel my biceps. Ooh! Whoa! Well, what do you think of your old man now, Son? [Grunts] Whoa! Damn right. How can you put that filth into your bodies? My casserole is not filth. Eat it. Look at you people. Bart's a tub. Lisa's weak as a little girl. And Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all. Now that's just not- You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action. [Clicks Tongue] Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean food. Sorry. I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti... into one handy, mouth-size bar. [Gulps] Hmm. [Beeping] [Line Rings] Hospital, please. [Grunting] Homer, please remember to wipe your sweat off that machine. I got a terrible rash yesterday. You know Rainier Wolfcastle? Yeah. He helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone. [Grunting] Yo, yo, Rainier, my man. How you doir? I thought you'd be here pumping those guns. We've come up with a killer promotion for Powersauce bars. Picture this. You- I love it. climb the highest mountain in Springfield. The Murderhorn. Are you crazy? That's suicide. [Scoffs] Sure! For experienced mountain climbers. But you're a movie star. And you'll have the Powersauce edge. Not for all the applesauce in Glückenschlabel. My dad could do it. He eats 50 dollars' won'th of Powersauce bars a day. Overshoot the extreme. Max the envelope and so on. Wow. He's really been paying attention to our slogans. Brad, a word? New angle: Joe Schlub eats Powersauce bar, becomes world's mightiest man. It's believable. That's what I like about it. Congratulations, sir. Huh? You're gonna be the first man to climb the Murderhorn. I am? Uh, no. That's it over there. [Gasps] Yeah. That's it. Just to the right of the one you're looking at. [Whimpers] [Whimpers] Oh. Homer: Okay. Mountain climbing supplies. Rope. Ice ax. Heart medicine. Son, don't go up that mountain. You'll die up there, just like I did. You? "Did"? Sure. It was the winter of'28. The Butter Baby Flapjack Company sponsored me and a fella named McAllister. We were almost to the top when we ran low on supplies. Heroically, I gave him the last short stack. Then that glory hog took all the supplies and headed for the top alone. [Screaming] I fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. Of course, folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbugging that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again. If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm 100% focused on my goal. Hey. My hat has earflaps. And when he reaches the top, Mr. Simpson here... will plant this Powersauce flag as an eternal symbol... of mars contempt for nature. Wait. Is "contempt" the word I want here? Homer, you're the world's greatest hero. Do you owe it all to Powersauce? That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Powersauce, the bar with "applesauceicity." Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing... and that this is all crazy? Well, yes. A number of people. But don't worry. We're sending two Sherpas along as guides. [Speaking Foreign Language] Aw. Good-bye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff. Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you? Well, yeah. Oh, cool. Now get goir. Chop-chop. Remember our agreement. He can't fail. [Homer Wheezing] [Oxygen Hissing] Oh, man. This is hard. Uh, Dad... shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher? Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced. Don't get discouraged, Dad. Only four vertical miles to go. Homer: D'oh! [Snoring] [Both Grunting] [Roaring] Huh? [Sighs] Wow. Look how far I climbed. And I'm not even tired. [Kicking] Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb. [Foreign Language] This Powersauce newsbreak is brought to you by Powersauce. Get sauced with Powersauce. Neil? Our top story: Homer Simpson has just "powersauced" his way... past the halfway point of the Murderhorn. Brad, could Homer have made it this far... without the engineered nutrition of six kinds of apples? No way, Neil. Oh. This just in. Powersauce is amazing! [Mutters] Huh? What the- Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain. Brad and Neil were quite insistent you not die. Frankly, we don't care. So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own. Then technically shouldn't you go back down and start all over? Shut up! You are so fired! Whoo-hoo! [Laughing] Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home, and I'm heading for the top- solo. Are you crazy? You'll never make it. The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Powersauce bars. Wake up, Homer. Those bars are just junk. They're made of apple cores and Chinese newspapers. Hey. Deng Xiaoping died. [Neil] Homer, listen to me. Turn back now! Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out. Homer Simpson, defying all medical advice... has switched to Powersauce's archrival, the Vita-Peach Health Log. Doctors say he may not have the mega-nutrients needed to stave off death. Oh, Dad's gonna die, and it's all my fault. I really need a good talking-to. Don't worry, kids. Your father will be okay... as long as he's with those Sherpas. Uh, Mom. [Groans] [Grunting] Eight. [Panting] [Grunting] [Groans] Air's getting thin. But I'm gonna make it. Ooh. Getting light-headed. Good. No heavy head to carry. Wait. I'll just take that escalator. ♪ [Humming] [Giggles] Huh? ♪ [Humming] ♪ [Vocalizing] ♪ [Vocalizing Continues] D'oh! [Grunting] Just a few feet more. I did it. I made it all the way to- Aw, crap! It just keeps going! [Sobbing] I give up. You beat me, mountain! [Sighs] At least I won't freeze to death. [Yelps] "Last entry: I have mountaineered to the utmost... "but the peak is unclimbable. "Worse still, that treacherous skunk, Abe Simpson... stole my oxygen and tried to eat my left arm." Ew, Dad! "Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her... "blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio." [Groans] My dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's dad! Me! [Sobs] This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpsors ever gonna get. This is for you, Son. [Grunting] [Gasping] Uh-oh. Hey. Wait a minute. I'm on the top. I actually did it! I climbed the unclimbable mountain! Bow down before me, everyone, for I am your king! Family to Dad. Family to Dad. Come in, Dad. Uh, I'm pretty sure he's dead, little girl. Here. Have a Powersauce bar. It's on the house. Hey. Something's comir down the mountain- fast! Oh, no! He fell! I can't look! [Faint Shouting] Hi. Oh, Homie! You're alive! Oh, Marge. I never thought you'd see me again. Where in the world did you find a sled on top of the- [Screams] [All Gasping] We're too late. He's dead. It looks like someone tried to eat him. What are you looking at me for? You're all crazy. Crazy as a- Okay. Here's what I think happened. Did you make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Did ya? Why don't you tell me, Son? See any interesting flags up there? All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off. Ah, damn it! Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest dad ever. Thanks, Bart. That makes it all won'thwhile. Is that your wallet? D'oh!
#09x24 - Lost Our Lisa^Ha-ha! Hey, Bart, what's your favorite thing about teachers' conference day? Mmm, I guess that we don't have to go to school. Wow! Mine too! The world is completely different on a weekday morning. Banks are open. Old people are walking the streets with impunity. And look! Barney's not even drunk yet. Morning, boys. Can't stop to chat. Time is money. Homer: Morning, Barney. You know what makes it even sweeter? While we're out havir fun and walkir around like crazy... those teachers are cooped up in school like morons! Mmm, here we go again. [All Laughing, Whooping] Skinner! Ah. No day would be completely wasted without a visit... to the old joke shop. [Buzzing] [Gasping] [Chuckles] Rookie mistake, Milhouse. [Groans] Check it out, Bart. X-ray specs! Hey, these don't work. Uh- Oh, a lead shirt. I'll take three pairs. Here's my prescription. Hmm. You wanna not play with that? Just got it charged. Maybe you can help me. I don't think my face is as hilarious as it could be. What can you show me in a nose or forehead accessory? [Bell Jingling] Whoa! Lookir sharp! Well, thanks, governor. Oh! If you put dog doo on the suction cups, they'll stick better. Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo... that's been on the dirty ground and put it on my face. I have a better idea. [Bird Squawking] [Both Grunting] [Snoring] Hey, Dad, wake up! Huh? What? [Muttering] I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team. You can't fire me! I quit! Please! I have a family. Relax, Dad, it's just me. I was wondering if you had any industrial-strength adhesive I could use on my face. Well, let's see what we got in the old drawer. ♪ [Humming] Eh. Eh. Aha! There's some glue. [Straining] Hope this stuff holds. This exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's the first time these Egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of England. Just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. You can get a picture of your mommy with a mummy. [Giggling] Whoops! There goes Carlsbad Caverns. Oh, well. Oh, I can't wait! In just 20 minutes... we'll be in a three-hour line to see the Orb of lsis. Ta-da! Notice anything new? Bart, what have I told you about throwing money away at that joke shop? To try and cut back a little? [Groans] Take those silly things off. [Grunting] It won't come off. [Grunting] [Groaning] Ow! Ow! Ow! Bart, did you glue those on? Oh, don't be ridiculous. "In case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician." Oh, my goodness! Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid. We've gotta get you to a doctor right away. Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow! Wait! You promised to take me to the museum! I know, honey, but this is a very unusual situation. At least, it would be for most families. What if I took a bus? A bus? Alone? Absolutely not. It's just too dangerous for an eight-year-old. In a few years when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus. But it's the last day of the lsis exhibit! Well, you should've thought of that before I glued all this stuff to my face. Na! [Snoring] [Phone Ringing] [Muttering] Y'ello? Dad? Who is this? It's Lisa. I just called to tell you how much I love you. And can I take the bus to the museum? Museum? Mmm, I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say? Um, I wasrt 100% clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room. Hmm. So you wanna take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision. Well, if it would put your mind at ease, I could take a limousine. Although, that would cost $200. $200? Oh! Isn't there any other way? Hmm. I guess I could take the bus if you think that's a better idea. Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo... but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus. [Sighs] All right. Attagirl. I love you- Yes! Ah, the old number 22. Clean, reliable public transportation. The chariot of the people. The ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. Sure, some folks prefer- Are you gettir on this next bus, kid? Yes. [Whistles] Taxi! V.D. clinic. [Gasps] Look! It's the bus! The bus! Come on! You're gonna miss the bus! [Chattering, Shouting] That's one small step- Whoa! Hi, Larry. I'm sorry. It's just that on the school bus- May I sit there? Of course not, honey. That seat's for my coin purse. May I have that seat? Yes, if you can answer me these questions three. Question the first- Never mind. [Driver On Speaker] Sycamore Avenue. Little Newark. Little Newark. Crackton. Crackton is the stop. [Siren Wailing] Lisa: Crackton? That doesn't sound right. [Driver] Industrial Access Road. Airport Refueling Way. Rural Route 9. Army Rroving Ground. Um, excuse me, sir? When does this bus get to the museum? It doesn't. Oh. But isn't this the 22? Yeah, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Tuesday, Thursday, it's the 22-A. 22-A? Then where the heck am I? Don't make me tap the sign. But I'm lost and I need to know where- Last stop. End of the line. [Sighs] I should've got off in Crackton. Okay, the museum's gotta be north of here. Now, which way is north? [Birds Squawking] Aha! It's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north! Hey! See, Bart? There's another boy who played with glue. Actually, it was a plumbing explosion. Ew! That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom. [Sighs] How could I confuse bus 22 with 22-A? Area 51? I found Area 51! No, ma'am. This is Area 51 -A. [Groans] Well, um, I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me where I am? I'm sorry. The location of this location is classified. [Groans] Stupid bus! It can't even go... to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go! [Groans] I seen it first! Ooh! Girlie Sue's gonna have a elegant weddir feast. Uh-huh. [Forced Chuckle] Uh, listen, I'm kind of lost. Do you think you could give me a lift downtown? Cletus, what are you beatir your gums about? Never you mind, Brandine. You just go back to birthir that baby. Yeah, I'll fetch ya a ride, little missy. Hop on in. Mind the skunk. [Insects Buzzing] Them things can go off even after they's dead. [Gags] [Baby Crying] Hmm. Young man, there's nothing funny about novelties. [Chuckles] I mean, they're humorous and all... but, uh, this is certainly no laughing matter. [Chuckling] [Groans] Can you help him, Doctor? Oh, my, yes. Why, if I had $75 for every novelty I've removed- Oh, by the way, I'll need a check for $75. Yes, I think a series of painful injections... directly into Bart's spine should get the job done. [Gasps] [Whimpering] Hmm? Marge: What happened? You didn't do anything. Oh, didn't I? [Chuckling] Nothing dissolves glue better than human sweat. I knew Bart would panic and start perspiring... at the sight of this button applicator. Couldrt you have just turned up the heat a little? Oh, heavens, no! It had to be terror sweat. [Eating Loudly] Oh, yeah. This is good. [Muttering, Indistinct] So, uh, ain't you guys gonna ask me about my hat? Ah! Ah! Hey, Carl, what's with the hat? Oh, what, this thing? I got it down at the museum. It's what the ancient Egyptians call a souvenir. My daughter's at that Egyptian dealie right now. [Laughs] She wanted to take a limo. But I made her take the bus. You sent your little girl downtown on a bus? Alone? Maybe. But you don't know Lisa. I mean, she's so smart... they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things. But she had so much knowledge, it overloaded. And then it got really hot and caught on fire! That never, uh, happened, did it, Homer? Uh, yes. But now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter. Oh, Lisa! [Groans] I didn't know Springfield had a Russian district. Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to the museum? [Shouting in Foreign Language] [Screams] Hmm. [Gasps] [Maniacal Laughter] Khlav Khalash! Oh! [Grunting] Hmm? No, thanks. [Wailing] [Panting] Oh, that's it. I give up. [Line Ringing] [Homer's Voice] You have reached the office of Homer Simpson. If you are calling about the water bed, please leave a detailed message. If you need- [Mr. Burns's Voice] Get back to work! [Gasps] You buy it! You buy it! [Yelling] Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! [Panting] Oh, where is she? [Horns Honking] Has anyone seen my little girl? Oh, for God's sakes, my little girl is- [Gasps] Hello. Homer, what's going on? Shouldrt you be at work? I am at work. This is what I do. But- Keep it moving, Marge! This isn't a parking lot! I'm sorry. Whew! [Screams] Shouldrt you be at work right now? Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Burns, sir. Well, then get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are. Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen this little girl? Uh, I'd love to help you, pal, but I'm on a stakeout here. Yoink! Ha-ha! Oh- Oh, great! Somebody stop that awful, awful man! Oh. Lisa! Lisa! D'oh! This is no good. I've gotta get up higher. Give me all your balloons. I hope this works. These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker. Well, I've already got some balloons, but they're not this nice. Deal! Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello? Somebody? Anybody? Oh! Lisa? Lisa? [Gasps] Lisa! Dad! Stay there! I'll come down and save you! What's wrong with this thing? [Gasping] [Yelling] Lisa! Save me! [Yelling] Hang on, Dad! D'oh! Ow! [Yelling] Ow! Look out! Oh, no. I'm gonna go off the end of the- D'oh! [Shouting, Indistinct] I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there... please save me, Superman. [Horn Blowing] Hurry! Hurry! Lower the bridge! You're the boss. Dad, grab onto it! [Whimpering] [Gasping] D'oh! Ow! Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay. D'oh! Ow! D'oh! Ow! You said to crush him, right? No! Are you sure you don't wanna go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head. Nah, I'll just walk it off. I should have known I wasrt old enough to take the bus alone... but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again. [Tires Screeching] Don't ever say that! What? If I hadrt have taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker... I never would've found you. I guess. Stupid risks are what make life won'th living. Now, your mother, she's the steady type... and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. That's why I have so many adventures. [Gasps] Dad, you're headed for the river again! Dad! [Chuckling] Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh? Dad, are you all right? I'm enjoying my life too much to care, and you should be too. So what would you like to do right now more than anything in the world? See the lsis exhibit! But the museum's closed. Hmm. Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feelir stupid? I know I am! Lisa, we're home! Sorry about the museum! [Groans] You'd better go up and apologize. But my apologies always sound so forced. Do it! Hey, Lise, I'm sorry I ruined your Egyptian thing. We're still buds, right? Okay, be that way! Be a big, stupid jerk! Oh! You're not the jerk. I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're Miss Perfect! Mom, Lisa's making me feel bad! Stop it, Lisa! That shut her up. Okay, just a little higher. [Both Grunting] Dad, I'm kind of scared. Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump. Okay. Here goes. [Grunting] Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file. Wow! It's magnificent! Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt... when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the Temple of lsis. Have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?

But I raised them and I love them. I know that's hard to understand. Mmm. Not as hard as you think. Run for it. Really? Okay, that's exactly one moment. And- Oh, my God! He's getting away! [ Gasping, Murmuring ] Stop him! Out of the way, Midge. Oh, am I in the way? Yes, yes, you're in the way! Are you daft, woman? Sorry. I didn't realize I was in the way. You're still in the way. You don't seem to be moving at all. Oh, for cryin' out loud, just knock her ass down. [ Moe ] Way to shove, Edna. [ Apu ] Let us roll. Guys, is it really true? Are you cold-blooded egg murderers? Don't use that look on me. I invented that look. There he is, off in the distance! [ Whimpering, Panting ] [ Smithers ] He's getting away.! [ Gasps ] Okay, Bart. This is where it ends. Relinquish the lizards. [ Gasping ] I said relinquish. Aah! [ Both Grunting ] [ Marge Gasps ] [ Grunting Continues ] Oh! Oh, no! You killed 'em! [ Groans ] Good riddance to bad lizards. Hmm? Hey! Whoa! Look at 'em! Go, Chirpy Boy! Go, Bart Junior! Oh, nuts! Wow. Did you know they had those webbed flaps for gliding? Yes. But I was hoping they didn't know that. Well, I hope you're happy, Bart. You have no idea what kind of plague you've unleashed upon this town. Our top story: The population of parasitic tree lizards has exploded... and local citizens couldn't be happier. It seems the rapacious reptiles have developed a taste for the common pigeon... also known as the feathered rat, or gutterbird. For the first time, citizens need not fear harassment... by flocks of chattering disease-bags. For decimating our pigeon population... and making Springfield a less oppressive place... to while away our worthless lives... I present you with this scented candle. [ All Cheering ] Yeah! All right! Well, I was wrong. The lizards are a godsend. But isn't that a bit shortsighted? What happens when we're overrun by lizards? No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese needle snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards. But aren't the snakes even worse? Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat. Then we're stuck with gorillas! No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death. Hmm. I'm proud of you, boy. [ Sniffs ] Mmm. Loganberry. I don't get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird... but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all. Hey, you're right. I call the front seat! You had it on the way over! Hey! [ Both Grunting ] [ Bart ] Out of my way.! Oww.!

I'vejust received some rather unusual news... regarding your unprecedented A-triple-plus. To be honest, I'm surprised and saddened- N-No. Not "saddened." What's the word? Ah, yes. "Delighted." What? I'm delighted to report that your grade... brought the entire school's G.P.A. up to our state's minimum standard. We now qualify for a basic assistance grant. It's the greatest honor the school has ever received... and it's all thanks to you. Your devotion to scholarship is a shining beacon to all who- Stop it! I cheated! Cheated! Cheated! Cheated! Cheated! Cheated! Lisa, what are you trying to say? I cheated! [ Gasps ] [ Skinner ] You cheated? Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Why didn't Miss Hoover tell me? She doesn't know. You're the only one I've told. Well, then, one could make the argument... that there really is no problem. But what I did was wrong. Oh, very much so. But as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner... we'll still get that grant money. [ Chuckling ] Oh, you really scared me there. But we can't accept that money. It's tainted. Now, now. Leave the money out of this. It's not the money's fault you cheated. Besides, I've already started spending it. Check out the new scoreboard. ♪ [ Fanfare ] [ Crowd ] Charge! [ Chuckling ] I'm still learning all the buttons. Well, if you're gonna cover this up... I'll just have to go over your head to Super- [ Loud Buzzer ] intendant- [ Loud Buzzer] Chalmers! [ Incoming Whistle ] [ Loud Explosion ] Skinner! I am outraged that you've kept this from me. You were supposed to call as soon as the new scoreboard was in. Tell me, does it play that song "Charge"? Oh, does it ever. You can't keep this scoreboard. Because there's not gonna be any grant money. Because I cheated! Lisa, let's take a walk. A little traveling music, Seymour. ♪ [ "Charge" Stomp ] Uh! Good Lord, what a dump. [ Dog Barking ] [ Cat Screeching ] It's not surprising. This school was once classified... the most dilapidated in all of Missouri. [ Together] Hmm? Huh? That's why it was shut down and moved here, brick by brick. Look around, Lisa. That grant money could do a lot of good. Don't you think those youngsters deserve a regulation tetherball? Ow! Ohh! We can buy real periodic tables... instead of these promotional ones from Oscar Mayer. Who can tell me the atomic weight of"balonium?" Ooh. "Dee-licious"? Correct. I would also accept "snack-tacular." And for the first time ever, our computer lab actually has a computer in it. [ Typing Slowly ] Hi, Lisa. Hi, Super Nintendo Chalmers. [ Beeps ] [ Meow ] I'm "learnding." Aw, way to go, Ralph. Oh, she's a beaut. You can't beat a Coleco. How many can I put you down for? A lot? Please say a lot. I need this. I don't know. I'm not even sure we can keep this one. It's up to Lisa. What do you say, Lisa? Will you keep our little secret for the good of your classmates and your school? And let's not forget old Gil, huh? The wolf's at old Gil's door. Oh, I guess I don't have much choice. Oh, thank God! Now let's talk rustproofing. These Colecos will rust up on you like that. Shut up, Gil. Close the deal. Close the deal. Relax, boy. We're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach. Ooh! Look, here's a little playmate for you. [ Yelps, Whimpering ] Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you? Arr! It's not his fault he's a sissy. Someone's been coddling him. Don't look at me. I wanted to eat him. Sorry. It's usually the mother. You know, I run a small academy for lobsters like this one. We stress tough love- daily chores and the like. No. We're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school. Arr. I understand. It's hard to let go. Uh, tell me this then. Do you have any spare change? And now to present the grant money... a legendary figure in educational disbursement- State Comptroller Atkins. [ Applauding ] Whoo! [ Flashbulbs Popping ] Thank you. I'm here tonight to honor the girl... whose unprecedented test score has set a new standard in excellence. Lisa. [ Applause, Cheering ] Thank you. I know this giant check is very important to everyone here... but what's even more important is the truth. What? Huh? [ Murmuring ] Because, after all, education is the search for truth. No. No, it isn't. Don't listen to her. She's out of her mind. And the truth is we don't deserve this grant... and I don't deserve your applause. I cheated on that test. [ Gasping, Booing ] Wait! How dare you condemn this girl? Who among you can honestly say you've never cheated? On your wives or your husbands. [ All Murmuring ] What she just did took courage. And where I come from- Canada- we reward courage. So I hereby decree that you keep the grant... and let's give this brave girl the ovation she deserves. [ Applauding, Cheering ] Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. You got the highest grade in the class. But, Mom- The highest grade. Okay. Lisa's gone. Places, people. [ Straining ] Man! Acting is tough. I'll be in my trailer. Oh, good old predictable Lisa. I knew her conscience was a ticking time bomb. Heads up! Here comes the real comptroller. This grant ensures a lightbulb in every classroom... and a high-definition TV for the teachers' lounge. [ Flashbulbs Popping ] [ Applause, Cheering ][/i] Now, where's the little girl who made this grant possible? Where's Lisa Simpson? [ Microphone Feedback ] [ Scattered Applause ] Come on up here, Lisa. Well, how about that? Smart and modest. Well, I should be going now. These giant checks don't hand themselves out. Okay, people, let's have a round of applause... for the real comptroller. [ Applause, Cheering ][/i] Hmm? Idiot. I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now. [ Cheering ] And so. That's one grade I truly earned. [ Groans ] Who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor? Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath. [ Sniffs ] Hey, what smells so good? Yeah- Pinchy? Pinchy? Oh! Pinchy! [ Whimpering ] [ Homer Sobbing ] [ Sobbing Continues ] Oh, man, that's good. [ Sobbing ] Oh, pass the butter. [ Sobbing ] [ Chomping, Swallows ] Are you gonna eat that all by yourself? [ Whimpering ] Uh-huh. Pinchy would've wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy. [ Grunting ] [ Cracking ] [ Slurps ] Oh, God! That's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. [ Sobbing ] [ Chomping ] [ Whimpering ] Oh, Pinchy.

Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time. No, he doesn't.

Whoo. I don't think he'll be doin' no encores for a while. [ Laughing ] I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid? The first episode was just a pilot, Dad. Producers fiddle with shows all the time. They change characters, drop others and push some into the background. [ Horn Honking ] Your character provides the comic relief... like, oh, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these. [ Bird Cawing ] [ Lenny Whispering ] Get ready, everybody. He's about to do something stupid. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen... but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now, if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about- D'oh! [ Laughing ] [ Lenny ] There goes Albany.! Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs! [ Laughing ] Oh, man. [ Horn Honking ] Whoa! It's that Homer Simpson dude. Ha-ha! People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get out of here. Forget the baby's medicine! But her forehead's on fire! Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home. Well, if it isn't that stupid cop from TV. [ Grunts ] Ah, yeah, that got it. That's Homer Simpson. Hey, that's Homer Simpson! [ Chattering ] Your catchphrase is hysterical. Please say it clearly for my answering machine tape. Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs. Worst... reading... ever. How 'bout an autograph? Picture, mister? [ Babbling ] Come on, people! Enough is enough! Oh, it's never enough. Not for them. Once they get a taste of you, they want more and more and more! That reminds me, do you mind if my nephew kicks you in the belly? Okay. [ Grunts ] Oh! Aw, the flash didn't go off. You got another one in you, Josh? [ Squeaking ] The whole town's laughing at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat! [ Bart ] Okay.! And that big yellow flower! Homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. Why don't you talk to the producers of the show? Maybe they'll make your character suave again. Hmm. I guess I could. But while I'm gone... keep an eye on that weird-lookin' kid down there. Bart? Yeah. "Bart." [ Clears Throat ] Uh- So I just wanna know, how come you made your Homer Simpson character so- Stupid? [ Laughing ] Well, I can assure you, it happened organically. It better have! The I 3 of us began with a singular vision- Titanic meets Frasier. But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in development... with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven. Who's Jeremy Piven? We don't know. But it scared the hell out of us, so we slapped together a cop show instead. Police Cops. Uh, no, actually, it was called Badge Patrol. The network idiots didn't want a show about high-tech badges that shoot laser beams. So we asked ourselves, who's behind the badge? Police. Cops. Police Cops. Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid? Oh, he's not stupid. He's a street-smart fish out of water in a world he never made. I'm begging you! I'm a human being! Let me have my dignity back! [ All ] Mm-hmm. D'oh! Let me down, Chief. I'm beggin' ya! I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back! [ Screaming ] Ow! Now he's stupid and whiny. That does it! There's only one thing I can do. Your Honor, I'd like to sue the producers of Police Cops... for $20 million for improper use of my name. Court finds in favor of Police Cops. Next case.

I'm going to give you the only name you spelled correctly. From this day forward, your name shall be- "Max Power"? Dynamic, isn't it? I love it, Max. You changed your name without consulting me? That's the way Max Power is, Marge- decisive, uncompromising and rude. Oh, wait a minute! The family name is my legacy to you! I got it from my father, and he got it from his father. And he traded a mule for it. And that mule went on to save spring break. But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this? Yes. Briefly. And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what? Oh, honey, they have acids that can burn that off. [ Grunts ] But I fell in love with Homer Simpson.

#10x19 - Mom and Pop Art^Marge, I'm out of beer! You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house. Hint, hint. But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store! I'm serious! You never finished painting the garage. And you still haven't taken down those awful hostage ribbons from the old oak tree. Oh, you know as soon as I take 'em down, there'll just be more hostages. And you could at least get that snake out of the piano. ♪ [ Middle Eastern ] [ Hissing ] Fine, I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you!

The only reason I'm working here... is 'cause I'm trying to get a date with Mom. Look, Pop. I'm planning some expert home repairs... and I need a pair of bolt cutters or wire cutters... or something to get the lock off my toolbox. Aisle one, next to the cat poison. Edna, look. A dimmer switch could ratchet up the romance in our love nest. You mean the janitor's closet? Ha! [ Sighs ] What's the matter, Edna? Lately you just say, "Ha!" to everything. I want a baby now.!

That's your license plate, isn't it? Uh- [ Crying ] All right! Just go ahead and sue me! Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000. I'm not here to sue you. My name is Astrid Weller. I own an art gallery, and I'd love to display your piece. You mean this hunk of junk? This isn't art. It's just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you? You stupid- [ Shouting ] Uh, art isn't just pretty pictures. It's an expression of raw human emotion. In your case, rage. Oh, I got that, lady. Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots. This lady says I'm an artist. You? An artist? Your husband's work is what we call "outsider art." It could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee. [ Gasps ] In high school I was voted most likely to be a mental patient, hillbilly or chimpanzee! Well, you should be very excited... because outsider art couldn't be hotter. So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it! [ Chattering ] [ Munching ] Dad, chew with your mouth closed. You're losing your mystique. Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns. You squeal on me, I'll kill you. [ Groans ] I don't know. I studied art for years, but I just don't get this. Sounds like somebody's jealous. No, I'm not. I just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars... for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash. Hey, I done studied for years on how to get over that junkyard fence. Then I learnt the gate was open. Smithers, I think I'm in love! Hah! With this sculpture. Sir, that's by Homer Simpson. I don't think you want to buy it. Smithers, years ago I blew the chance to buy Picasso's Guernica for a song. Luckily that song was "White Christmas"... and by hanging on to it, I made billions. Anyway, I love this hideous thing. Young lady, I'll take it! Congratulations, Homer. You're now a professional artist. Whoo-hoo! Look, Marge! My first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns! Huh? [ Homer Grunting ] Where you going with that junk, Dad? I'm gonna be an outsider artist. That way I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia... and antiques into something valuable. Homie, I'm really happy you sold your sculpture. But don't you think it may have been a fluke? Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days... when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr. That's my life you're describing! I think I remember my own life, Marge. Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me. I'm Mr. Mellow. [ Together] Hmm? So I'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. Come on. Give me what you got. Well, if it'll help. Uh, Mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy. [ Grunting ] Good work, honey. Keep it coming. Well, I'm flunking math, and the other day I was a little attracted to Milhouse. [ Shouting, Screaming ] Moe, this is Astrid, my dealer. And these are my fans: Gunter, Kyoto and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil. So, uh, you guys are Eurotrash, huh? How's that working out for you? Eh, to be honest, we are adrift in a sea... of decadent luxury and meaningless s*x. Uh-huh. So, uh, where might this sea be located? Hmm? I must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. Bonsoir.! [ Pops ] What do we owe you, Moe? Nothing, nothing. Just give me a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity. All right. [ Muttering ] Hey, Moe! Can I pay with a drawing? Yeah. Nice try there, twelve step. [ Groans ] [ Bird Squawks ] Uh, Homer, you're making us a little bit uncomfortable. Relax, big guy. He's just doing this for his art. Right, Homer? Oh, yeah, art. Here he is. This is where the magic happens. Wonderful news, Homer. Is it about pies? I, um- No. We're going to hold a show devoted entirely to you. Wow! It's like Marge's dream come true- for me! Isn't that great, Marge? For me. [ Groans ] Look, Marge. They're advertising my show in Art in America. It's the first time I've been mentioned there- that I know of. I'm happy for you. Now good night. Good night. You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu? Oh, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying... you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life. Aw, honey. I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like. That's sweet. But how would you like it if I- I don't know- entered a belching contest. Frankly, I'd be a little turned on. [ Groans ] You don't understand. Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good. Well, I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy. Now you're making sense. Good night. [ Snoring ] Then I bought a Rembrandt- [ Burps ] Homer is the most dangerous artist on the Springfield scene. [ Applause ] I give you Botched Hibachi. The tricycle's on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection. This piece I call... Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chain Saw and Applesauce. And finally, my thing de resistance... Attempted Birdhouse I. [ Squawking ] [ All Murmuring ] Shall we start the bidding at, say, $1 0,000? [ Throats Clearing ] All right. How about a million? I'll give you two bucks for the bird if it's still alive. What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff. Homer, I'm afraid they only love what's new and shocking. These pieces are just like your earlier work. You've gone from hip to boring. Why don't you call us when you get to kitsch? [ Chuckles ] Come on, Gunter, Kyoto. If we hurry, we can still catch the heroin craze. Mmm! Wait! Come back! I'm a god to you! Worship me or fear my wrath! Oh, please, fear my wrath! Please! Call me. I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore? Homer, I know you worked hard. But all of your things were kind of the same. Hey, RayJ.Johnson never changed his act, and he's more popular now than he's ever been. Who? You can call him Ray. Or you can call him J. Or you can call him RayJ. But you doesn't have to call him- I'm sick of him already. The point is, great artists are always trying new things... like Michelangelo or Shaquille O'Neal. You just need some inspiration. It's so exciting to do something cultural together. Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw! Ow! Oh, no! I'm being erased! Move it, bub.! We got an installation to "installate. " Ooh! A Claes Oldenburg. He's a European who defied convention... and embraced American popular culture. [ Impressed Whistle ] He must be a hundred feet tall. Now this is a Joseph Turner. In an era when everyone else painted portraits... he broke away by painting the Venetian canals. It's glorious! The streets are paved with water! You could ride a walrus to work! And Picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. By the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. They call it his Angry Jerk Period. [ Guttural Sigh ] Mmm, split-pea. [ Gasps ] With ham! Any ideas yet? No. These guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil. Oh! I'm just gonna rest for a minute. [ Snoring ] [ Growling ] [ Sniffing ] What the-Who the- Hey! [ Karate Yells ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] You're mean. Hasta la vista, baby! [ Groaning ] Hmm? Uhh! What the- Eww! [ Gasps ] D'oh! [ Grunts ] Soup's on, fat boy.! Ooh! Ow! Hey! No! No! Help! No! Ow! No! Yo, Andy, no! Homer! Homer! Marge! Oh, why does art hate me? I never did anything to art. Oh. Let's get out of here. Well, Dad, if the museum didn't inspire you... maybe you should do something really radical, like Christo. Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets? No, Christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. He once wrapped the Reichstag in plastic. Not the Reichstag! Oh, yes. And he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along a California highway. Why did he do that? To make the world a more magical place, I guess. Although they did blow over and kill some people. Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite. No, Dad. No, my point is you have to do something big and daring. Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again! Step one: steal all the doormats in town. Hit the road, "Welcome Home"! Adios, "Casa de Flanders"! See ya in hell, "God Bless This House." So long, "The Simpsons"! D'oh.! Step two:snorkel the animals. [ Panting ] It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies. Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions. Make sure you strap 'em on real tight. Now, step three. Are you sure this is art- [ Coughs ] and not vandalism? That's for the courts to decide, Son. [ Birds Twittering ] [ Creaking ] [ Homer On Bullhorn ] Wake up.! Wake up, Springfield.! I've got a surprise for you. Oh, Lord! What now? [ Chittering ] Oh, that can't be good. People of Springfield, behold my latest work! Homer, what have you done? It's conceptual art- The Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice, without the black plague. What do you think? I think some people are going to be upset. I love it, Homer! You've turned this town into a work of art! I just wish Jasper Johns hadn't stolen my boat. Aah! So long, suckers.! Well, they're in the business. Real people might not be so understanding. What the flood? Maude, it's a miracle.! The Lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous. [ Gasps ] Isn't that Homer Simpson? [ Scoffs ] Looks like heaven's easier to get into than Arizona State. Ohh! I hate these flood pants. Hey, they're working! My feet are soaked, but my cuffs are bone-dry! Everything's comin' up Milhouse! [ Men, Women ] Ahh.! ♪ [ Man Singing Love Song ] Edna, I'm gonna pop you a question... and... I hope the answer is yes. Do you think mother would like this hat pin? Oh. Yes. Oh, you've made me the happiest man on Earth! Well, Homer, I have to admit... you created something people really love. You truly are an artist. No. I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family. Aww. Is that our house? Yep. And is that us on the roof? That's us. Are we kissing? Oh, I don't know.

I have here a letter from a little girl named Lisa Simpson.

Well, I say we don't bring her the torch. I say we bring her... the Olympic Games! Who is with me? [ Cricket Chirps ] Well, I don't care. It's my decision. Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics. Economists predict our city will experience the same boom... that Sarajevo enjoyed after the I 984 Games. And it's all because of your letter, Lisa. Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment. Everyone else wrote to the Backstreet Boys. To honor the arrival of our foreign friends- and enemies- Channel 6 is sponsoring a contest to find a Springfield Olympic mascot. The winner will join such other memorable mascots... as the Atlanta whatsit and the Montreal vampire. A mascot contest? I'm sure to win that- unless one of you jinxes me.

#10x21 - Monty Can't Buy Me Love^[ Man ] And welcome back now to Cash in Your Legacy. This week we're appraising antiques in Springfield. This gentleman's beer tap dates back to the turn of the century... and remarkably, seems to have never been washed. Yeah, yeah, I've been meaning to wash that, but- [ Chuckles ] it's been such a century.

Inspired by the most logical race in the galaxy, the Vulcans... breeding will be permitted once every seven years. [ All Gasp ] For many of you, this will mean much less breeding. For me, much, much more. Ya cannot do that, sir! Ya don't have the power! Ladies and gentlemen, I must apologize. This man does not speak for the Council of Alphas. We hold you subomeguloids in the highest regard. When are we gonna get to my broccoli juice program? Quit butting in, please. Your I.Q. is a mere I 5 5... while mine is a muscular I 7 0. [ Singsongy ] I am smart. Much smarter than you, Hibbert! You should all do what I say. My I.Q. is I 99, for crying out glavin. [ Groans ] 1 98. I 97. [ Computerized Voice ] Big deal. My I.Q. is 280. [ All Gasp ] [ Together] Stephen Hawking! The world's smartest man! What are you doing here? [ Computerized Voice ] I wanted to see your utopia. But now I see it is more of a Fruitopia. I'm sure what Dr. Hawking means is- Silence. I don't need anyone to talk for me, except this voice box. You have clearly been corrupted by power. For shame! Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink! [ All Shouting Agreement ] I don't know which is a bigger disappointment- my failure to formulate a unified field theory, or you. I don't like your tone. If you are looking for trouble, you found it. Yeah, just try me, you- [ Screams ] [ All Cheering ] Now's our opening! Come on, you idiots! We're taking back this town! Yeah! Let's make litter out of these literati! That's too clever. You're one of them! [ All Shouting ] Please stay calm everyone. [ Screams ] Time for this Hawk to fly. Wrong button. [ Lisa ] Help! Lisa, thank God you're okay. Did you have fun with your robot buddy? Dad! Oh, Dr. Hawking, we had such a beautiful dream. What went wrong? Don't feel bad, Lisa. Sometimes the smartest of us can be the most childish. Even you? No, not me. Never. I guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world. Wow, Mom, that's very profound. Hey, you read that off my screen. Who's up for some beers? I am! That's the smartest thing I've heard all day. Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer. I may have to steal it. Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of... is hanging out with a guy like me. All right, it's closing time. Who's paying the tab? [ Homer, Monotone ] I am. I didn't say that. Yes, I did. D'oh.
#10x23 - 30 Minutes Over Tokyo^Hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of Weird was here? [ Chuckles ] I love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies. Dad, it's not- "Gigabytes." [ Laughing ] They've done it again. "Gigabytes." Wait-This isn't Weird. Why, there's no magazine called Weird, is there? This is Wired. It's about computers and technology. Hey, look. There's a cybercafe opening right here in Springfield. Will you take me, Dad? Please? I'll show you how to order pizza over the lnternet. The lnternet? Is that thing still around? I know a Web site that shows monkeys doin' it. Bart, the lnternet is more than a global pornography network. It's a- [ Horn Honks ] Come on, Lisa. Monkeys. [ Groans ] Ach. Let's see what's been captured on the up-kilt camera. [ Beeps, Whirs ] Ew. This lass needs a bit of grounds keeping. Eh? Aah! That's Willie! My name is Mary. I'm 45, heavy and willing to settle for less. Wow. This Mary's got the whole package. Wow, Dad. You're surfin' like a pro. Oh, yeah. I'm betting on jai alai in the Cayman lslands. I invested in something called News Corp- Dad! That's Fox! [ Screams ] Undo! Undo! [ Groans ] Dad, do we have any money left? Well, let's check the old bank account. [ Beeps ] See? Even after my cyber squandering... we've still got $1 ,200. All right, dorks, this is a holdup. [ Gasping, Murmuring ] Oh, yes! Download to papa. [ Beeping ] Yoink dot adios, back-slash losers. [ Groans ] [ Marge ] We were robbed? You seem to know an awful lot about this for an innocent person. We were saving that money for our family vacation. Now we're gonna have to start all over again. [ Groans ] Aw, don't worry, sweetheart. I'll get us the money- even if I have to get a second job. Evenin', neighbor. Low on funds again? Yes, sir. Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us... every time you got a bill to pay. I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir. It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle... while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive. Oh, we're-We're not as well off as you think. We give to eight different churches just to hedge our bets... and the Leftorium's business has gone way down hill... since Leftopolis moved in next door. If you're not rich, then how come you have a new refrigerator... an electric can opener, a milk shake machine? [ Chuckling ] We picked those up cheap. They were evidence at a murder trial. Sweet. We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar. Go on. He taught us how to live... a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar. I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing. Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right. Are you tired of missing out on the good things in life- Family vacations, jet packs, Solid Gold Dancers? There's only three left in the world. Well, stick around, 'cause I'm gonna tell you... the I 2 savings secrets Wall Street won't tell you. Then I'll show you the three ways to get back to the highway- including one shortcut those Wall Street fat cats don't want you to know. [ Cheering ] Oh, here we go with the fat-cat bashing. Well, what do you expect? These yokels are pure Baltic Avenue. [ Chuckles ] Uh-oh! I'm late for the Short Line Railroad. [ Tires Squeal ] Let's start with mega secret number one: "Ya gotta squeeze every penny." You see this tux? I got it cheap 'cause Roy Cohn died in it. [ Murmuring ] That fancy yacht? A bargain, 'cause it smells like cat pee. [ Murmuring ] And those beautiful women? They used to be men. [ Groaning ] The point is, ya gotta squeeze every penny. Come on, let me hear you. [ Together] Squeeze every penny. Squeeze every penny. I'm squeezing. I'm squeezing it. [ Slurping Sound ] Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand. Oh, Homer, not again. Ew. We're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-cent store? Well, maybe for your wedding. [ Bart ] How about here? Not if we want that vacation. Look, Mom. They have your dress. [ Groans ] Thirty-three cents? I paid almost double that. Blue? Wow! This plankton's only 33 cents. According to the Mexican Council of Food... this expired two years ago. Sure, by their standards, but we live in America. [ Chomping, Groaning ] This also says it can cause red tide poisoning. But it's so cheap. Well, let's see what's in the old vacation fund. Homer, you could have just unscrewed the bottom. A little late for "could-haves," Marge. I don't think there's enough here for a vacation. There is for a Mega-Savings vacation. Chuck Garabedian says you can fly mega cheap... if you don't care where you go. That's right.Just go to the airport and wait for some no-shows. Then you can buy their seats for a fraction of the price. Are you going through our garbage? That's right. You fat cats didn't finish your plankton. Now it's mine. Hawaii, here we come. No. No. We're going to Paris. I can feel it. Come on, Transylvania. [ With Jamaican Accent ] No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long. [ Woman On P.A.] Attention. Flight 605 to Tokyo is ready for departure... and has four available mega-saver seats. [ Both ] Yeah! Come on, Homer.Japan. No, not Japan, Jamaica. I wanna pass the dutchie on the left-hand side. Never mind. Looks like the Flanders are gonna get those seats anyway. Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh? [ Groans ] Come on! Whoo! [ Horn Honking ] Sayonara, suckers. [ Snarls ] Yea! The Simpsons are going to Japan. [ Gong Sounds ] Hey, watch the gong, jerk. Come on, Homer. Japan will be fun. You liked Rashomon. That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we wanna see Japanese people... we could have gone to the zoo. Homer! What? The guy who washes the elephants is Japanese. His name is Takashi. He's in my book club. Look, Mom. The safety instructions are written in haiku. "Fasten seat belts tight. "Your seat cushions float gently. Headsets, five dollars." [ Beeping ] Sir, it is not safe to use electronic devices yet. You're the waitress. [ Beeps ] [ Attendant ] Turn it back on.! Turn it back on.! Ooh. I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies. Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom. Gonna be on towards the end of the flight. Toga! Toga! Toga 2,000! Marge, they stole my idea. The local time is... tomorrow. [ Homer] Here's our room. Homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open. I don't have time for that. [ Grunts ] [ Man's Voice ] Welcome. I am honored to accept your waste. [ Beeps ] ♪ [ Bells ] [ Gasps ] They're years ahead of us. Mom! Lise! Check it out. Dad's on TV. Oh, yeah! [ Marge, Bart, Lisa Screaming ] [ Gasps ] It's breathtaking. Look. There's the lmperial Gardens. The Meiji Shrine. The Hello Kitty factory. [ Cats Yowling ] [ Yowling Stops ] Who's up for some exploring? Hey, I'm still checking out Japanese TV. ♪ [ Synthesizers ] Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures? [ Beeping ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] Bart, what are you doing? [ Grunting, Groaning ] Hey, what the- [ Grunting, Groaning ] Hmm. All right. [ Grunting, Groaning ] Robots be right back. Whoo! All that seizing made me hungry. Me too. Let's go to an authentic Japanese noodle house. The toilet recommended a place called Americatown. Dad, we didn't come halfway around the world to eat at Americatown. I'd like to see the Japanese take on the club sandwich. I bet it's smaller and more efficient. [ Man ] We now return to Battling Seizure Robots. [ Beeping ] [ All Moaning ] [ Mechanical Clicking ] I can't believe they stuck us at "Tax-a-chusetts." Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket. And? Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated. Howdy, gangstas. I am average American Joe salary-man waiter. These prices suck. 1 0,000 yen for coleslaw? Don't you serve anything that's even remotely Japanese? Don't ask me. I don't know anything. I am product of American education system. I also build poor-quality cars and inferior-style electronics. [ Laughs ] Oh, they got our number. One square watermelon, please. Oh, my goodness. Homer, those are $1 50. It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit. D'oh! Well, maybe we should just head back to the hotel. But you promised me we'd do something Japanese. Oh, of course you're right. You know, I read about a Shinto teahouse... where they practice the traditional- Run, Bart! Hey. Isn't that Woody Allen? Hmm. Looks like he's doing a commercial. Oh! [ Clears Throat ] Hello. [ Clears Throat ] So many rice crackers claim to be low-cal... but only Fujikawa rice crackers make your interiors go bananas. What did I do to deserve this? Oh, right. Mmm. Fifty-dollar pretzels. Hey, what's Baby Huey doin'? Says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring. Hmm. Spare some salt, tubby? Tubby? [ Speaking Japanese ] Yoink. Hey, that's mine! [ Yells ] Hey. [ Grunts ] [ Crowd Groans ] Like we say in my county, "Hasta la vista, baby." Congratulations. I am the emperor. Yeah? And I'm "clobber-saurus." [ Gasping, Sighing ] All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus. [ Booing ] Your wife has paid your bail, Mr. Simpson-san. Thank God. Couldn't take another minute in this hellhole. [ Chomping ] Now can we do something Japanese? Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the 47 Ronin... and I wanted to be Yoshi, but they made me Ori. Then we had to do two hours of origami... followed by flower arranging and meditation. [ Speaking Japanese ] Honey, I know you wanna see Japan... but we're down to our last million yen. Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese. Oh, it's beautiful, Dad. It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck. Oh, be careful. We need that money to get home. [ Marge Gasps ] No! [Japanese ] [ Man ] Now, Mr. Simpson... I know you lost all your money, but don't worry. The United States will not stand idly by... while one of its citizens is stuck here like this. [ Grunts, Groans ] But, Mr. Ambassador, how are we going to get home? Beats me. Try getting a job and earning some money. That's what I did. By the way, "ambassador" is taken. [ Groaning ] Every truckload of fish we gut... brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home. And I think I finally found what I was put on this Earth to do. Knife goes in, guts come out. Knife goes in, guts come out. Spare my life and I will grant you three wi- [ Screams ] Knife goes in, guts come out. Yippee! Time for the company loyalty song. ♪ [ Singing ] [ Groans ] Well, this sucks. What else is on? [ Bell Ringing ] [ Cheering ] [ Laughs ] Thank you. You have fulfilled our dreams, and dreams of our ancestors. [ Male Announcer ] Tune in tomorrow, when another lucky family... tries to win their dreams... on Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. Family Wish Show.[/i] Hmm. That gives me an idea. I think we all had that idea. I didn't. What is it? Lunch? Thank you, thank you. And welcome to our contestants from America, the Simpson family. You honor us. Don't patronize me. Now, Simpson family, have you picked a wish? Well, I haven't talked it over with the family- [ Chuckles ] but I think we'd all like a free dinner at Americatown. No, no, no. We want plane tickets home to Springfield. [ Cheering, Whistling ] Now, our game shows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance. Ignor-What? [ Screams ] [ Laughing ] Okay, let's begin. Our categories are: "Ow. That hurts. " "Why are you doing this to me?" And "Please let me die." [ Bell Dings ] "Ow. That hurts." Oh, yeah, number one. Definitely. I don't know. I like "Why are you doing this?" "Ow. That hurts." We'll go with "Ow. That hurts," Skip. My name is Wink. [ Groans ] [ Laughing, Chattering ] All right, Simpsons, whack the pinata. [ Groaning ] Come on! Whack that pig open. Once more. Harder. Whack it open. [ Laughing ] Good. All right. You may remove your blindfolds. [ Groaning ] Oh, sorry, Dad. We didn't know. I had an inkling. Could someone please whack my hernia back in? Sure, thing, Dad. Mr. Simpson, we'll cut you down... as soon as you answer one question about Japan. Is the answer "Japan"? Actually, it is. [ Speaking Japanese ] That means you move on to the lightning round. [ Moans ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Screams ] He seems okay... but he is being burned internally. [ Screaming ] Hey, isn't that Homer on the Japanese Channel? If that's Homer, then who the hell's been puttin' beers on his tab? D'oh. Whoo-hoo. Uh-That boy ain't right. [ Host ] Congratulations, Simpsons. The airline tickets are yours. All you have to do is to pick them up... from inside that volcano. Why are you so cruel? [ Laughing ] This vacation really blows. Well, at least we're past the lighting round. [ Screams ] Hmm. I see. I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round. [ Screams ] Mmm. I don't think that bridge can support much weight. Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than- Oh, I'll just go. [ Groaning ] [ Together] Plummet! Plummet! Plummet! Plummet! Plummet.! Plummet.! Plummet.! Plummet.! Plummet.! Plummet.! Yes! Got 'em. [ Together] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.- [ Buzzes ] [ Screams ] [ Gasps ] Lisa! [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] Oh.! Marge! Your shoe! The plane tickets! [ Grunting ] Whoa! Whoa! Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end. Well, at least we'll die doing what we love- inhaling molten rock. [ All Screaming ] [ Cheering ] [ Screams ] It burns! It burns! Don't worry, that "lava" is just orangeade... made by our sponsor, Osaka Orangeade Concern. It burns! It burns! It's loaded with wasabi. Kudos, Simpsons. You have won your freedom. [ Audience Cheering ] Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty. They're about greed and wonderful prizes... like poorly built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame. [ Groaning ] Coming up next, a Canadian couple... who say they are deathly afraid of scorpions. Oh, that stings, eh. [ Screams ] Ooh, God! Ow! Ooh! [ Screaming ] Sting those Canucks. [ Laughs ] I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers. [ Groans ] Good-bye, Japan. I'll miss your Kentucky Fried Chicken... and your sparkling, whale-free seas. Hey, what's goin' on? What's happening? [ Beeping ] [ Man On P.A.] Folks, we're experiencing... some moderate Godzilla-related turbulence at this time, so I'm gonna go ahead... and ask you to put your seat belts back on. [ Screeching ] When we get to 35,000 feet he usually does let go... so from there on out, all we have to do... [ Yawning ] is worry about Mothra, and we do have reports... he's tied up with Gamera and Rodan at the present time. Thank you very much. [ Roaring, Screeching ] [ Godzilla Screeches ] [ Murmuring ]
